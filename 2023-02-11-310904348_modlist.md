## Adorn

Decorate your home!

**Adorn** is a decoration and furniture mod for Minecraft 1.16 that adds many decoration blocks, such as...

- Chairs and sofas! You can sit and relax on them. A sofa is also a nice place for a nap.
- Drawers! Smaller container than chests, but a fancier piece of furniture.
- Stone torches! They're made of stone and are better light sources than wooden torches.
- Kitchen blocks! You can decorate your kitchens with kitchen counters, cupboards and sinks (Perfect for kitchen sink modpacks!)
- And more: tables, shelves, fences, chimneys...

## AdvancementInfo

Show more information about advancement requirements

This mod will enlarge the advancements info UI, so it'll use most of your screen, not just a tiny part of it, especially when your GUI scale is high.

This means more info visible at the same time, less scrolling, and a better overview.

Also, it checks out which requirements you've met and which you haven't, and displays a list of those to the right of the UI. This makes it much easier to find what you have done and what you still need to do.

For example, the "Discover every Biome" Advancement doesn't tell you what's still missing; this mod will help you go for that last biome you haven't visited.

This works with data pack Advancements as well; here's an example from BlazeAndCave:

![Screenshot](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/G1epq3jN/images/18e15e0dd7ffa0a9e1eb5eaa85bf0fa1dabf0777.png "Screenshot")

If the list to the right overflows, you can use your mouse scroll wheel to scroll.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Advancements, and their objectives, have their very own names, which may or may not correspond to MineCraft items, blocks, or entities. The mod tries its best to map those names to Minecraft objects, but in some cases, especially with Data Packs, that's just not possible. The mod will show the internal name in that case in the hope you're better at deciphering what's needed than the mod itself. 

For example, the objective of "The Parrots and the Bats" is named "bred", this will show as bred in the info box. 


This is the very first version of the mod, and as such, there are probably still bugs. Please report them!

To make sure the mod doesn't slow down your minecraft, 
it has been optimized using

## Amecs

Improves your keys & controls setup by providing modifier keys and making multi-functional keys a thing.

**Requires Fabric API.**

---

### Amecs: Alt-Meta-Escape-Control-Shift
Amecs is a mod that tries to improve your keyboard immersion. Therefore it introduces several modifier keys (alt, control and shift) for now to give you a larger variety to chose from when making keybindings.

Amecs also removes that annoying key blocking where only one functionality can be associated with a key.

_Disclaimer: Duplicate entries will still turn red to let you know of possibly unwanted collisions._

And there's yet another feature: Amecs introduces a search bar for your controls screen! No more searching for that one nasty keybinding in a giant list.

And last but not least it adds keybindings for toggling auto jump as well as each of the skin layers.

## AntiGhost

Get rid of ghost blocks by requesting resends from the server

Want to help translate this mod to your language?
======================================
You can help me translate this mod on https://crowdin.com/project/antighost.

Mod description
===============

Ghost blocks are blocks that seem to be air to the client, but are solid to the server. They occur when the server and client are out of sync; in many cases, this happens when a haste effect wears off and there's some network latency between both. The server tells the client the haste effect is gone, but the client doesn't know about this yet and sends block break events to the server at full speed. The server thinks the client is cheating so it doesn't break the blocks; the client doesn't know that so it thinks the blocks are air now. When the player tries moving into those blocks, the server kicks him back.

I've seen this most often on servers that have MCMMO enabled, when super breaker runs out, but it happens when beacon effects are ending as well.

Generally, the only way to fix this is relogging, or porting away and back, to unload and re-load the chunks. This mod asks the server to resend all blocks around the player when you type /ghost, within a 4 block radius cube, thus making relogging unneccesary. Or, just press the G key.

The effect, and the mod in action, can be seen on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHhuU9j4ORo

## AppleSkin

Food/hunger-related HUD improvements

Adds various food-related HUD improvements. This is a mostly client-side mod, but it needs to be on the server in order to display accurate saturation/exhaustion values on the client.

---

*Note: AppleSkin provides information about some mechanics that are invisible by default (it does not add or change any mechanics). To read about Minecraft's exhaustion and saturation mechanics, see the [Minecraft wiki article on Hunger](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Hunger#Mechanics)*

---

#### Features

* Adds food value information to tooltips:

![](https://i.imgur.com/YksBaUx.png)

* Adds a visualization of saturation and exhaustion to the HUD:

![](https://i.imgur.com/tmImVqo.gif)

* Adds a visualization of potential hunger/saturation restored while holding food:

![](https://i.imgur.com/aHf1QxQ.gif)

* Adds a visualization of potential health restored while holding food:

![](https://i.imgur.com/jUOKFUl.gif)

* Adds hunger/saturation/exhaustion info to the debug overlay (F3)
* Syncs the value of saturation and exhaustion to the client.

---

#### Misc
You are welcome to add this mod to any modpack you'd like.

---

#### Use on vanilla servers

One of the following plugins can be used to get the saturation/exhaustion to work when connecting to vanilla Minecraft servers:

## Architectury API

An intermediary api aimed to ease developing multiplatform mods.

## Architectury API

Talk to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/C2RdJDpRBP)!

An intermediary api aimed to ease developing multiplatform mods.

#### What is Architectury API

Architectury API is an api to abstract calls to fabric api and forge api as both loader has different implementations of
what can be perceived as the same thing.

Architectury API updates regularly, with new hooks and features. Currently contains over **90** events hooks, networking
abstraction, loader calls abstraction, game registry abstraction and an easy to use @ExpectPlatform annotation (Only
works on static methods).

#### Do I really need this API?

Architectury API is only one part of the architectury ecosystem, **Architectury Plugin** is the gradle plugin enabling
all this multiplatform actions.

Architectury API is optional for projects built on architectury, you may create your architectury project with just
Architectury Plugin.

#### Advantages of Architectury

- Open sourced
- Less boilerplate for your multiplatform mod

#### Getting started with making multiplatform mods

Architectury Loom: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-loom (a fork of Fabric Loom adding multiplatform development capabilities)

Gradle Plugin: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-plugin (includes Architectury Injectables, for the `@ExpectPlatform` annotation)

Example Mod: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-example-mod (a discontinued example mod using Architectury, if possible, use the templates instead)

Mod Templates: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-templates (a set of templates to get started using the Architectury toolchain)

#### Example: Usage of @ExpectPlatform
![Exmaple of the @ExpectPlatform annotation, part of Architectury Injectables](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/78c68766affb70fbd88f9806e0e95f78765ec339448d7102065f2942be2b3215/68747470733a2f2f6d656469612e646973636f72646170702e6e65742f6174746163686d656e74732f3538363138363230323738313138383130382f3737363432383831343330393738353632302f756e6b6e6f776e2e706e673f77696474683d31313931266865696768743d343339)

## AutoModpack

Say goodbye to manual modpack installation with Automodpack mod, for effortless updates and easy management.

## Welcome to AutoModpack,

What is this?
AutoModpack is a Minecraft modification that aims to simplify the process of updating modpacks. With this mod, players no longer have to manually update each mod or the entire modpack. The tedious task of updating is handled automatically, making the experience more seamless and enjoyable.



I do not take credit for any of the content that can be downloaded from the mod. Likely all materials, except for the mod itself, were created by various talented individuals!

### Key features
- Auto modpack updating for seamless player experience.
- Effortless modpack management for admins, including the ability to easily manage mods, configs, resource packs, and more.
- Auto Synchronization of modpack content with server mods for consistency and reliability.
- Dynamic modpack updates without disrupting player experience.
- Quick and simple installation process.

### How it works?
On server AutoModpack generates a file called modpack-content.json on the server, which contains all the mods, configs, resource packs, and other necessary files for your modpack. The server also hosts this file, as well as all the files contained within it, on an HTTP server.

When a client joins the server, the modpack automatically downloads the modpack-content.json file from HTTP server and all the files contained within it, if they haven't been downloaded yet. The client simply needs to wait a few seconds for the files to download, install, and restart the game. Once the process is complete, the client can join the server again and enjoy the modpack!


### How to use

First of all download the latest version of the mod from [here](https://modrinth.com/mod/automodpack/versions).

Put it into the `/mods/` folder of your minecraft/server installation.

Launch the game your game/server.

**- Client**

1. Join the server. Now modpack will be magically downloaded, installed. You will only need to click few buttons to confirm download and restart the game.
2. Join the server again and Enjoy!

**- Server**

1. Open port (default: `30037`) on your server! need to host modpack.
2. Restart server

and you are good to go!

**Want to add more content to your modpack?**
- To add mods to your server, place them in the `/automodpack/host-modpack/mods/` directory. 
And so analogically to add shaderpacks, put them in `/automodpack/host-modpack/shaderpacks/`. You can create any subdirectories you need within `/automodpack/host-modpack/` folder.
- Or add whatever file/folder from server main directory to the `syncedFiles` list in `/automodpack/automodpack-server.json`

**Want to delete some mods from modpack?**
- Just delete what you want from `/automodpack/host-modpack/` directory on your server.
- Or check and delete whatever file/folder from list `syncedFiles` in `/automodpack/automodpack-server.json`

**Want to exclude some mods from `syncedFiles`?**
- Just add them to the `"excludeSyncedFiles` list in `/automodpack/automodpack-server.json`

### Commands

- `/automodpack` - Status of automodpack and general help.
- `/automodpack generate` - Generate new modpack.content file on server.
- `/automodpack host` - Status of modpack hosting.
- `/automodpack host start` - Start modpack hosting.
- `/automodpack host stop` - Stop modpack hosting.
- `/automodpack host restart` - Restart modpack hosting.
- `/automodpack config reload` - Reload config files.


### Common problem

**Got errors every time you try to download the modpack?**

- Take a look at your server log after starting the server. See if there's a notice about the modpack host launch and make sure the IP is correct (it may only be the last digits of the IP).

- If the IP isn't right, head over to the config file and change the "hostIp" to your server's correct IP (without the port).

- Having trouble with the local host IP? No worries, just repeat the process but change "hostLocalIp" instead.

## Axes Are Weapons

Disables the increased durability loss in combat and enables Looting for axes

## Axes Are Weapons

Found your axes break too fast in combat? Annoyed you can't get Looting on it?  
Then this is the mod for you!  
  
Axes normally lose 2 durability when hitting things because they are considered a mining tool, not a weapon.  
This mod makes axes lose only 1 durability point, just like swords.  
It also enables Looting for axes, while Knockback, Fire Aspect and modded sword enchantments can be enabled in the config.  
By default, damage enchantments (Sharpness, Smite and Bane of the Arthropods) will now also appear in the Enchanting Table, so you won't have to rely on books.  
  
The config has more (by default disabled) options like fast Cobweb breaking and "All Tools Are Weapons", which enables all features for all tools.

- for Minecraft 1.16-1.19 
- requires [Cloth Config](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config)
- works *mostly* server-only - fast Cobweb breaking will only work when the client has the mod and enabled the setting too

## AzureLib

Based off Geckolib but now just for my own needs.


 
Slayer background without logo is credited to THIS 

  


AzureLib is a fork of Geckolib, an animation engine for Minecraft Mods, with support for complex 3D keyframe-based animations, 30+ easings, concurrent animation support, sound and particle keyframes, event keyframes, and more. This library will be where I start storing my common code for my projects so there will be other things added soon outside of Geckolib things. 
 

Available for Forge 1.19.3 and Fabric/Quilt 1.193.

## bad packets

Bad Packets allows packet messaging between different modding platforms.

## bad packets
Bad Packets is a library that allows packet messaging between different modding platforms.

This means a Fabric client version of a mod that uses Bad Packets can send a packet to a server that uses the Forge version and vice versa.

This mod **DOES NOT** magically make all mods that have versions for different platforms to be compatible with each other, the developer needs to use BP's API to send its packet. Even then there are more complicated things like game object id sync that this mod doesn't handle which makes it unrealistic to support in the first place.

## Better Beds

Changes the renderer of the bed to use json models instead of a block entity renderer! 

Removes the Block Entity Renderer from the bed and replaces it with the default minecraft model renderer. This results in increased performance and resourcepack support!
(Completely clientside mod) But where's the catch, you may ask. Well, there is almost no catch, everything behaves the same as vanilla.
The only mod that's incompatible so far is Bedspreads, since that mod uses the block entity renderer of the bed.
Also, mods that add custom beds using the default renderer need model files provided for them.
Mods that add beds using a custom block entity renderer are untouched. Why does the bed use a block entity renderer in the first place? When beds were added in 1.12, the game was still using the old block id system, which only allowed for a limited amount of ids.Because 1.12 added many new blocks, the game was running out of ids, so the developers made the bed a block entity + renderer to save ids.In 1.13 (The Flattening) a new id system was introduced, allowing for an unlimited amount of ids, but the bed block entity and it's renderer weren't touched.
&nbsp;
I iNstalLed tHiS mOD bUT iT LoOks tHE sAme aS VaNiLla!
By default this pack includes models that perfectly mimic vanilla behavior, to change the look of the bed,
install one of the example resource packs from here or create your own pack based on the examples.

## Borderless Mining

Changes Fullscreen to use a borderless window.

Borderless Mining changes the fullscreen option to use a borderless window that fills the screen. This allows you to have Minecraft open on one monitor, while using other programs on another monitor - as normally Minecraft minimises when you unfocus it. This mod also adds the Borderless Windowed option to the Video Settings screen, so you can easily disable the mod ingame, and has a configuration menu accessible through Mod Menu.


Works on vanilla servers, and modded servers without the mod installed!


This mod is a rewrite of a Forge 1.12 mod, [Fullscreen Windowed (Borderless)](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/fullscreen-windowed-borderless-for-minecraft), however it used to be a fork of that mod (which the 1.12 version of this mod is) - see the bottom of this page for the original description.


See [Borderless Window](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/borderless) by nekeras if you're looking for a similar mod for Forge 1.14+.


On macOS this mod is disabled by default, as it is impossible to position the window above the menu bar, and macOS has better fullscreen support anyway.


Old 1.12.2 mod description

This is the latest released version (1.6.0) of the mod [Fullscreen Windowed (Borderless)](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/fullscreen-windowed-borderless-for-minecraft) by hancin for MC 1.12-1.12.2, plus a fix for window resizing by me, compiled by Brycey92. This fork will be obsolete if [this PR](https://github.com/hancin/Fullscreen-Windowed-Minecraft/pull/27) is merged.

This fixes the bug where the window is not resizable after exiting fullscreen. This is a bug in LWJGL, and is fixed by [Fullscreen Fix](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/fullscreen-fix) and in current versions of Forge. However, the existing fixes are not applied to Fullscreen Windowed (Borderless), so this fork fixes it in that mod.

See the original Github post by Brycey92 [here](https://github.com/Brycey92/Fullscreen-Windowed-Minecraft/releases/tag/1.6.0-1).

## Chat Heads

See who you're chatting with!

 
This clientside mod adds player heads next to chat messages, as seen on the screenshot above.
It makes telling various people in chat apart a bit easier, and it looks *hella* nice.

Based on a request from Hugman on the Fabric discord.

[Cloth Config](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config) (and [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) for Fabric) is needed to access the settings, but the mod works without it, using the default settings.
 
Note: The default settings might not work on some servers. In this case try using the "Heuristic only" sender detection mode. Note that this might put wrong chat heads on some messages.

## Chime

Adds predicates for more interactive item models

Chime is a mod that adds a predicate system for more dynamic and interesting item model variation. It supports the ability to vary model based on countless conditions, such as the item's name, enchantments, NBT, dimension, entity, and plenty more. Chime is built in with vanilla's predicate system, building on it instead of replacing it with a foreign system. The Chime wiki has exhaustive information on Chime's format, as well as information on how to use it as a resource pack or mod maker. This includes examples and documentation.

## Cinderscapes

A biome mod expanding the life of The Nether


&nbsp;Cinderscapes is a beautiful, yet frightening biomes mod for Minecraft 1.16 and 1.18.2 running on the Fabric mod loader. Cinderscapes enchances the default minecraft experience by adding four new rich and detailed nether biomes following in the same style as those already in the vanilla game. In addition to new biomes Cinderscapes adds some new unique types of building blocks further expanding your building capabilities.

Cinderscapes requires Fabric Loader and Fabric API&nbsp;
Check out the Terraformers Discord Server to chat about Cinderscapes and other Fabric mods!
The two central tenants of the Cinderscapes project are refinement and simplicity, so in order to uphold those central values, the few biomes that Cinderscapes does add have gone through rigorous polishing, detailing, and refining to make sure all additions are up to the community's standards. Focus has been placed on depth rather than breadth and we hope that it clearly shows. Overall we hope this will result in a more cohesive experience compared to existing biome mods.
Biomes:

Ashy Shoals
Blackstone Shales
Luminous Grove
Quartz Cavern

Images of the biomes can be found on the Images page.
&nbsp;
Cinderscapes also contains some wonderful music from members of the community. Special thanks to Etorna_Z, LudoCrypt, and BoyBeyondTheStars for their compositions. To see more work from Etorna_Z make sure to check out their Soundcloud page, and for more work from LudoCrypt make sure to check out their bandcamp and their profile. To see more work from BoyBeyondTheStars check out their YouTube channel.
Arobazz was also kind enough to share with us their rose and smoky quartz textures for use in Cinderscapes. To see more of their work check out the Builder's Basics mod or take a look at their profile on Curse Forge.
&nbsp;
Other Mods by Terraformers:
Check out the sister biome mods, Traverse and&nbsp;Terrestria:
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
Terrestria and Traverse work well with Cinderscapes if you wish to expand your overall biome experience in the Overworld as well.&nbsp;
Campanion, your camping companion:

Campanion adds various tools and utilities to help improve your adventures away from your home. Campanion also works well alongside biome mods in order to make the exploration of the biomes even more fun.
&nbsp;
Cinderscapes is a mod for Fabric, and there are no plans to port this mod to Forge.&nbsp;

## CIT Resewn

Re-implements MCPatcher's CIT (custom item textures from optifine resource packs)


CIT Resewn is MCPatcher's CIT features re-written outside of optifine as a standalone mod for fabric

[](https://citresewn.shcm.io/)

[](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cit-resewn)

#### Huh? What does it do?
MCPatcher had a feature called Custom Item Textures(or CIT for short) which was later adopted by Optifine.

Custom Item Textures allowed resourcepacks to replace the appearance of items when they met certain conditions.

CIT Resewn does exactly that but as a standalone Fabric mod which does not require MCPatcher nor Optifine!

On top of that, CIT Resewn aims to build upon the concept of CITs by expanding the available types and conditions.

#### How is it different than MCPatcher/Optifine's CIT?
CIT Resewn is intended to be fully backwards compatible with the old Optifine/MCPatcher packs. Though there are some key differences.

First, the numeric id system was removed since the Flattening. Packs utilizing the so called "magic numbers" instead of the new text ids will not work.

Second, Optifine and old minecraft versions have a bug which allows resourcepacks to put files in malformatted(or "broken") paths.
These are paths that contain "Non (lower cased) a-z, 0-9, dots, underscores and dashes" characters within either the file name or its parent directories. In the case that you must use such a broken pack, there is a compromise set up which is still highly experimental and not recommended. You can go to CIT Resewn's settings and allow broken paths. (I'm serious, this is not recommended at all)

Lastly, to ensure compatibility with foreign packs, CITs will be loaded from .properties files under:
`assets/minecraft/citresewn/cit`
`assets/minecraft/optifine/cit`
`assets/minecraft/mcpatcher/cit`

#### Does CIT Resewn support Optifine/Sodium?
While CIT Resewn is designed to work without any performance mod needed, I will try my best to ensure it is compatible with Sodium.

With all that said, there will not be support for Optifine at all.

There were also discussions around Sodium alternatives such as Canvas.
My official statement on compatibility with these mods is "if it works it works" unless I say otherwise.

#### What about Forge?
Forge is being kinda doodoo recently and Fabric's Mixins is what allows the mod to inject cits into vanilla so smoothly.

Do not ask for a forge port or I'll break your elbows.

#### 1.16/other versions?
See [Issues#120](https://github.com/SHsuperCM/CITResewn/issues/120)

If a version says it's for 1.x, it means it is aimed to work on all of 1.x's minor versions but specifically recommended for its listed minor version.
Well not anymore! Thanks a lot mojank   ._.

## Clear Skies

Tiny mod that removes the banding at the horizon of Vanilla Minecraft.

Clear Skies removes the banding at the horizon of Vanilla Minecraft.  Has no dependencies and is generally very compatible with other mods.

License: LGPL-3.0-only

## ClickThrough

Click through signs and item frames to chests

This mod helps you access containers (chests, shulker boxes, barrels, but also hoppers, dispensers, ...) that are marked with a sign or item frame. Right-clicking a sign or item frame that's attached to a container will open the container instead.

Unlike other similar mods, it's purely client side, so it works on any kind of server - vanilla, modded, or spigot/paper.

You can still rotate items in item frames by sneaking and clicking them.

The same goes for signs that have some functionality attached by the server, for example, buy/sell signs on a server that has ChestShop or a similar plugin enabled.

### Port Notes

* Some versions of CraftPresence for Minecraft 1.14.x and above require
  the [FabricMC ModLoader](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api)
* Some versions of CraftPresence for Minecraft 1.13.x require
  the [Rift ModLoader](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/rift)
* Versions of CraftPresence for Minecraft 1.1.0 and below
  require [Risugami's ModLoader](https://mcarchive.net/mods/modloader)

### Features

In addition to having the ability to change your discord status from "Playing Minecraft",
This mod offers plenty of customization options to specify entirely how others see you play.
From having your current biome show up, to which dimension your in, as well as which server you're in, and more.
The customization possibilities are limitless, with the only real limit being how creative you customize your display.

#### Launcher and Pack Integration Support

CraftPresence will detect whether your Launch Directory contains:

* A valid Twitch/Overwolf/Curse/GDLauncher Manifest (manifest.json, minecraftinstance.json)
* A MultiMC Instance (instance.cfg)
* A MCUpdater Instance (instance.json)
* A Technic installedPacks File (installedPacks)

If using any of these launchers, note the following:

* Prior to v1.6.0, it'll put the packs name in your display as well as show its icon (when not in a
  server)
* From v1.6.0 until v2.0.0, it'll instead parse the Pack's name into the `&PACK&` placeholder, that you can configure
  for
  usage in the RPC
* In v2.0, the pack's info is instead parsed into the `pack.name` and `pack.icon` placeholders, that you can configure
  for
  usage in the RPC

As an example, this is how the mod will convert a pack's name to an iconKey:

Example: `All the Mods 7` would parse as `allthemods7`

Note: MultiMC natively has an Icon Key Property that is used instead of converting from the Pack's Display Name

### Commands

CraftPresence currently offers the following Commands:

Keep in mind the following:

* Commands must be prefixed by either `/craftpresence` or `/cp`
* In v1.5.0 and above, these commands are only usable via the Commands Gui, found within the Config Gui

___

* `/cp compile "[expr]"` - Test the output of a placeholder expression, via Starscript
* `/cp search (type:typeName, [searchTerm], all)` - Search for valid placeholders available to use with Rich Presence
* `/cp reload` - Reloads mod data
* `/cp request` - View Join Request Info
* `/cp export` - View export commands for mod data
* `/cp view` - Help command to display the commands available to view and control a variety of display data
    * `/cp view placeholders` - Displays all available placeholders for use in the RPC
    * `/cp view currentData` - Displays your Current RPC Data, in text form
    * `/cp view assets (custom | all)` - Displays all asset icon keys available to you
    * `/cp view dimensions` - Displays all Dimension Names available for use, requires `Show Current Dimension` to be
      enabled
    * `/cp view biomes` - Displays all Biome Names available for use, requires `Show Current Biome` to be enabled
    * `/cp view servers` - Displays all Server Addresses available for use, requires `Show Game State` to be enabled
    * `/cp view screens` - Displays all Gui Names available for use, if Per-Gui is enabled
    * `/cp view items` - Displays all Item Names available for use, if Per-Item is enabled
    * `/cp view entities` - Displays all Entity Names available for use, if Per-Entity is enabled
* `/cp reboot` - Reboots the RPC
* `/cp shutdown` - Shutdown the RPC (Can be turned on from `/cp reboot`)
* `/cp (help | ?)` - Help Command to display the above commands and these explanations

### KeyBinds

CraftPresence currently contains the following KeyBinds:

Notes:

* In v1.5.5 up to v1.8.0, KeyBinds are now customized in the Accessibility Settings in the Config Gui, and not the
  normal controls menu
* In v1.8.0 and above, KeyBinds can now be customized in either the dedicated menu in the Config Gui or the normal
  control menu on applicable versions

___

* `Open Config Gui` - KeyBind to open the CraftPresence Config Gui (Default: GRAVE/TILDE Key)

### About Placeholders and Functions

In some configuration areas, CraftPresence provides some placeholders and functions to make things easier:

Keep in mind the following:

* In v2.0.0, placeholders have been rewritten to be compatible
  with [Starscript](https://github.com/MeteorDevelopment/starscript)
    * The older list of this section can be
      viewed [here](https://gitlab.com/CDAGaming/CraftPresence/-/wikis/Legacy-Placeholders-(v1.x))
    * All Placeholders, functions, and code expressions must be surrounded with curly brackets (Example: `{foo.bar}`)
    * In the event that you need to combine a placeholder with other data in a function argument, use the `getResult`
      function
    * Additional functions and standard variables are available
      within [StandardLib](https://github.com/MeteorDevelopment/starscript/wiki)

___

#### Placeholder List

The following placeholders are available for use anywhere in CraftPresence:

* General Placeholders:
    * `general.brand` - The Minecraft branding label
    * `general.icon` - The default display icon
    * `general.version` - The Minecraft version label
    * `general.mods` - The amount of mods currently in your mods folder

### Versions of CraftPresence

Beginning in v1.5.2, CraftPresence is now split into different editions, based on the Minecraft Version you use it in:

* Legacy Version (Minecraft 1.2.5 and Below):
    * Server Support is unavailable in 1.2.5 and Below (Only SinglePlayer will work with showGameStatus enabled)
    * Minecraft 1.1.0 and below may not work on Forge, and may require a Modified Minecraft Jar with Risugami's
      ModLoader + ModLoaderMP
    * Alpha 1.1.2_01 has its Dimension and Biome Modules disabled, since the logic for that was not present in the game
      until a1.2.x

**Support for issues related to Vanilla code, Forge, or older/deprecated ModLoaders is extremely limited**

### Disclaimers & Additional Info

#### Minecraft Object Obfuscation

Due to obfuscation in Minecraft, some of Minecraft Objects such as Screens, Dimensions, or Servers must be opened once
in the session to be separately customized.

This has been resolved in v1.8.12 for MC 1.12.x and below, due to newer Translation Logic, but some issues may still be
present.

#### Icon Requesting

Not seeing an Icon you like or have a suggestion for an Icon to add/modify on the default Client ID?

If so, you can make a request on my [Issue Tracker](https://gitlab.com/CDAGaming/CraftPresence/issues/), with the
following requirements:

* If adding an Icon from a dimension, specify the Mod's link that the dimension derives from
    * This is because specific Icon IDs must be used, which can be found by the mod or from checking your Logs/Chat
      after entering the dimension as CraftPresence will tell you the ID expected
* An Icon of size between `512x512` and `1024x1024` to be used (Either minimum or recommended size for best quality)
    * Icons between these sizes can be used, but may not give a great final quality
* If requesting an icon to be modified or removed from the Default Client ID, please specify a reason why
    * Mostly just so it can be logged why it was changed for future reference

Additionally, you can also create your own Set of Icons by
following [this guide](https://gitlab.com/CDAGaming/CraftPresence/-/wikis/Making-your-Own-Client-ID-+-Using-your-own-Images)

## DashLoader

Launch at the speed of light.


    
     This mod accelerates the Minecraft Asset Loading system by caching all
    of its content, This leads to a much faster game load. It does this by caching all of its content on first launch
    and on next launch loading back that exact cache. The cache loading is hyper fast and scalable which utilises your
    entire system.  Important notes:  
    &bull; The first time your launch DashLoader it will be significantly slower. Because it needs to
    create a cache which contains all the assets minecraft normally loads. This will also happen every time you change a
    mod/resourcepack if that configuration does not have an existing cache.   &bull;
    DashLoader has been known to be incompatible with a lot of mods. DashLoader 3.0 has massively improved compatibility
    by not forcing mod developers to add explicit support to make their assets cachable. This means that DashLoader will
    load assets normally for mod assets that cannot be cached. While this improves mod compatibility it hurts speed as
    the minecraft loading system is quite slow.   &bull; If you use DashLoader for Developing
    mods or creating resource packs you can press f3 + t to recreate the cache to load your new assets in.
    If you want to just show off the speed of DashLoader you can press shift + f3 + t 
    
    
    
        
    
    
    
    
    YourKit
    Makes amazing profilers for both Java and .NET.
    We use their Java Profiler to understand where to optimize further and make DashLoader faster. 
    
    Creates excellent IDEs for all programmers and have provided us
    with access to their enterprise products for use to develop DashLoader and Hyphen.

### What if I want to enable some bug fixes, but not others?
Debugify has a configuration GUI accessible by Fabric's [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu).
If you don't want to it, there is always the configuration file located at
`.minecraft/config/debugify.json`

![configuration menu](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43245524/191992486-4ba9bd8f-db37-4021-b302-7f54701d8b08.png)

### Client, or Server?
Debugify includes many fixes for both the client and server (all server fixes also apply to client).
So you should definitely use it on both.

### Can I include this in my modpack?
Yes! Of course! I even added a little feature in the mod for you! The constant updates may be exhausting to maintain,
so I added a config option that defaults new bug fixes to off, until you get round to looking at it.

## Do a Barrel Roll

Microsoft flight simulator for Minecraft elytras.



### Overview

Do a Barrel Roll is a lightweight, fully clientside mod for Fabric and Forge that changes 
elytra flight to be more fun and semi-realistic.
It achieves this by redesigning movement with a 
completely unlocked camera orientation in mind, 
allowing for full pitch, yaw and roll control in flight.

Some subtle and less subtle modifiers are also applied to the camera,
including but not limited to smoothing and banking.

![](https://github.com/enjarai/do-a-barrel-roll/raw/main/img/ravine.gif)

### Controls

The default controls are as follows, but can be modified:

- Mouse x axis to roll
- Mouse y axis to pitch
- strafe keys (normally A and D) to yaw

### Configuration

The mod can be configured in-game using ModMenu on Fabric, or the builtin mods button on Forge and a compatible config library.
Currently, Cloth Config, YACL and Configured are supported.
Once you install any of these, 
you can access the config screen by finding the mod in your mod menu of choice and pressing the config button.

A wide range of options are available, including custom mouse behavior, elytra activation restrictions and
changing values of modifiers like banking, sensitivity and more.

### Server-side features

Visual aspects of the mod (playermodel roll in particular) can be synced between 
clients by installing it on the server-side as well. 
Everything is still fully compatible with both vanilla clients and servers. 
All the following configurations are valid:

- Server with mod, client with mod: visuals are synced
- Server with mod, client without mod: client can join and play without issues, but can't see visuals
- Server without mod, client with mod: client can join and play without issues, but can only see their own visuals
- Server with mod, client 1 with mod, client 2 with mod, client 3 without mod: client 1 and 2 can see each other's visuals, client 3 cannot
- Server without mod, client 1 with mod, client 2 with mod, client 3 without mod: client 1 and 2 can only see their own visuals

![](https://github.com/enjarai/do-a-barrel-roll/raw/main/img/do-a-barrel-roll.gif)

### Disclaimer

This mod does not actually modify the flight physics themselves, 
so in most cases it shouldn't trigger anticheat. 
However, doing things like loop de loops looks to the server like rapid camera movement
and may get you flagged.
**Use at your own risk.**

specifically it's "realistic mode".

## Durability Viewer

Armor and Tool durability HUD

Want to help translate this mod to your language?
======================================
You can help me translate this mod on https://crowdin.com/project/durabilityviewer.

Mod description
===============

This is another mod that shows your item durabilities as I couldn't find one that had everything I wanted.

Differences to other similar mods are:

* Show item durability numbers in color (green/white/yellow/red) depending on items state
* Items that are at almost 100% show damage, not durability. For example, your diamond pick that was used 5 times will show -5, not 1556. Great when you're using the mending enchantment to fix your stuff and don't know the exact number you want to reach
* Also show number of empty inventory slots; know at a glance if you can continue mining or should return to your chest
* Shows the amount of time for your buffs to run out so you don't have to press E to check whether that water breathing potion lasts for another minute (can be turned off in options)
* Play a warning sound when your item is about to break; stop losing your Efficiency V pick to not looking at the GUI. The warning will play when your item is at less than 10% AND less than 100 - since 1.4, these values can be configured.
* Set your window title to "&lt;Username&gt; on &lt;Server&gt;" so if you have more than one instance of MC open you can alt-tab to the one you're looking for easily. Can be turned off in options.

Durability Viewer was the first mod I ever made, and the fact that 61352151511 made the source code for his Durability Show (https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/durability-show) available on GitHub helped a lot. Thank you very much!

Configuration
============

All versions are configurable, but the way to configure them depends on the version and mod loader you're using.

- Forge until 1.12: Use the Forge-built in Mod config options.
- Rift 1.13: There's a book icon in the right top of the main and pause screen, click that.
- Fabric without ModMenu: Same as Rift.
- Fabric with ModMenu: Use the cogwheel icon that ModMenu shows when you select the mod.
- Forge 1.14/1.15: You'll have to edit the config file yourself. Check out the config .json file, which is in the config folder, next to the "mods" folder.
- Forge 1.16: You can configure the mod by pressing CTRL and the show/hide button (default is h)

**Configuration has two options that control the ripping sound** - less than percent and less then absolute durability. The ripping sound will only be played when durability is lower than both of them, so setting them to zero will make the sound play only when your item finally breaks.

If you want to replace the sound, open the .jar file in a zip utility (7zip, winzip, winrar, ...). and replace the assets/durabilityviewer/sounds/tool_breaking.ogg file with your own. Or, remove that file from the jar to get rid of the sound forever (or at least until you redownload the jar file).

To make sure the mod doesn't slow down your minecraft, it has been optimized using jprofiler (https://www.ej-technologies.com/products/jprofiler/overview.html).

## Dynamic FPS

Improve performance when Minecraft is in the background.

Dynamic FPS automatically reduces the speed at which Minecraft renders when it's not focused (to 1 FPS) or hidden (no renders at all).

It also fixes a bug in Vanilla Minecraft that makes it take much more performance in the background than it should, as well as making the game not render while reloading resources (which can make it take forever on machines with integrated GPUs).

There is an in-game config screen. To access it, install [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) and [Cloth Config](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config)—find Dynamic FPS in the mod list, then click the gear button.

## EntityCulling

Using async path-tracing to hide Block-/Entities that are not visible

## EntityCulling

Using async path-tracing to skip rendering Block/Entities that are not visible. [Website.](https://tr7zw.github.io/project/entityculling/)

Minecraft skips rendering things that are behind you, so why is it rendering everything that you still can't see because of a wall in the way? This mod utilizes your other CPU cores/threads to do really quick path-tracing from your camera to all block/-entities to determine rather they are visible or not. During the rendering, the not visible ones will be skipped the same way entities behind you are.

### Dependencies

- none

### Incompatible

- none (With some mods you might need to add the blocks to the config whitelist to fix visual issues)

### Tested with

- Sodium
- Iris
- Optifine
 
### Note to why it works even with Sodium/Optifine

This has been tested with other mods, Optifine(Optifabric), Iris, and Sodium, in all cases resulting in fps gains in places like Game Server lobbies.

You might wonder why it does increase the FPS with Sodium since Sodium has "Use Entity Culling" in its Advanced settings and enabled by default. The difference is that Sodium does a really quick pass based on the visible chunks, being way less aggressive and thereby still rendering entities that just happen to be in visible chunks, but not visible themselves.

### FAQ

#### Does this have to be installed on the Server?

No, this is fully Client-side and can't be installed on servers.

#### Will this influence farms/mobs?

No. Since this mod just skips the rendering, mobs will still spawn/move/drop items.

### 🤔 What does this mod do?

ETF is a Fabric (Quilt compatible) & Forge mod that adds many new _Entity Texture Features_, including entity and player skin features!
This way, ETF achieves more OptiFine parity on the Fabric mod loader. If you want more OptiFine features on Fabric, you can either check [this list](https://lambdaurora.dev/optifine_alternatives), made by LambdaAurora, **or** you can use the [Fabulously Optimized modpack](https://modrinth.com/modpack/fabulously-optimized), which includes **all** the OptiFine parity mods!

#### Featuring:

- [🎲](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README-assets/RANDOM_GUIDE.md) Custom & random entity textures with the OptiFine format, including even more properties!
- [💡](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README-assets/EMISSIVE_GUIDE.md) Emissive/glowing entity textures with the OptiFine format
- [😑️](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README.md#-blinking-textures) Blinking mobs
- [🎨](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README-assets/SKIN_GUIDE.md) Player skin features

### Compatibility

- OptiFine's random/custom or emissive entity resource packs -  **Fully compatable**
- [Custom Entity Models mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/cem) -  **Fully compatible**
- [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) -   **Fully compatible**
- [Iris Shaders](https://modrinth.com/mod/iris) -  **Fully compatible**(Support varies depending on the shader)
- Mod added entities -  **Compatible**(Only if the mod creator used the vanilla rendering code to render their mobs)

### Settings & configuration

- Settings can be changed in-game using [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu), the settings button in the resource pack screen, or  by editing the config file, located under `config/entity_texture_features.json`
- A few of these options can also be changed via the [Puzzle mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/puzzle)



### Mod support

- This mod should be compatible with any mod added entities as long as they extend `LivingEntityRenderer` class for rendering and utilise it correctly
- Any mod displaying an entity in a custom GUI can force the default texture by having the `entity.getblockstate` set to either `null` or of type `VOID_AIR`, the same can be achieved by settings the display mob's UUID to `UUID.nameUUIDFromBytes(("GENERIC").getBytes())`. 

### FAQ

 My entities are invisible/broken!

> Custom Entity Models is not a feature provided by ETF. If your entities are invisible or look corrupted you'll need to instal the [CEM mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/cem) (this includes resource packs such as Fresh Animations). Keep in mind that the CEM mod is still in alpha development and may still occur issues.

 Blocks and items are not emissive!

> ETF does not support emissive block and item texture, for that you'll need to install [Continuity](https://modrinth.com/mod/continuity).

 My game is lagging, help!

> If you are experiencing lag please check your most recent log file to see if any errors are being logged, sometimes an incorrectly written properties file or missing textures may lag the system.

 It doesn't work!

> Check if any issues are not actually a problem in the properties file, a few packs seem to be pointing to a texture that doesn't exist.
 So far all mob entities support random & emissive textures, but there may still be some quirks. If you find bugs you can either [report them in GitHub](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/issues/new?assignees=Traben-0&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBUG%5D+%22short+issue+description%22) or get support in the Discord server (linked on the top of the page).

> Emissives are broken with Complimentary shaders, what do I do?

>Complimentary shaders has its own in-built emissive textures that usually work fine but will conflict with some resource packs. You can either disable Complimentary's emissives or ETF's emissives to fix this.

 My question isn't here!

> Feel free to check ETF's [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/rURmwrzUcz) to ask your questions or check the FAQ there :)

## Equipment Compare

Makes it easier to compare equipment by showing a tooltip for what you're already wearing.

Equipment Compare is a configurable client-side mod that simply makes it easier to compare equipment at a glance.&nbsp; Highly useful in a modded environment with lots of unique items to compare!
This mod works differently than most tooltip "comparison" mods--it just shows a tooltip for what you're already wearing next to the tooltip for what you're hovering over.&nbsp; By doing it this way, there is much wider support for new stats and features added by other mods.

All versions besides the 1.12.2 version require Iceberg, you can download it here.

Client / Server
This mod is fully client-side.

Configuration
By default, you can show comparison tooltips by holding the shift key and hovering over an item.&nbsp; This is configurable as a keybind in the inventory section of the controls menu.
The configuration file for the mod also has options to reverse this behavior (always show comparisons unless the key is held), as well as color and text options for the "equipped" badge that shows above tooltips.
Additionally, you can specify a list of item IDs to blacklist if you'd like to disable comparisons for certain items.
&nbsp;
You are free to use this mod in modpacks.

## Fabric API

Lightweight and modular API providing common hooks and intercompatibility measures utilized by mods using the Fabric toolchain.

## Fabric API

Essential hooks for modding with Fabric.

Fabric API is the library for essential hooks and interoperability mechanisms for Fabric mods. Examples include:

- Exposing functionality that is useful but difficult to access for many mods such as particles, biomes and dimensions
- Adding events, hooks and APIs to improve interopability between mods.
- Essential features such as registry synchronization and adding information to crash reports.
- An advanced rendering API designed for compatibility with optimization mods and graphics overhaul mods.

Also check out [Fabric Loader](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-loader), the (mostly) version-independent mod loader that powers Fabric. Fabric API is a mod like any other Fabric mod which requires Fabric Loader to be installed.

## Fabric Tailor

A server-side / singleplayer skin & cape changing mod for fabric.

Need to quickly change your skin without going to minecraft.net? Or do you want per world-specific skin in your singleplayer?

## Fabric Tailor

  

A server-side or singleplayer skin changing / restoring mod. All with one simple command: 

### `/skin`

(You can also use keybind on the client)



It supports skin fetching via player's name as well as via URL. If you use player name, cape is fetched as well (if player has one). Not fan of existing skins? No problem, mod supports uploading skin from local storage as well.

As a side feature, it also requests textures from ely.by and mojang to work like *skin restorer* for server / singleplayer.

## FastQuit

Lets you return to the Title Screen early while your world is still saving in the background!

### FastQuit

#### About this mod

This mod lets you return to the title screen early while your world is still saving in the background.

Don't worry, the mod will wait for the world to finish saving when necessary, no data will be lost!

The world will show up on the world list, and you can even edit, delete or recreate it while it is still saving.
This is done by reusing the info from the still saving world.

In its current state this should be safe to do as measures for thread safety have been taken.
If you do somehow still encounter an issue, the worst thing to happen will be the action failing and Minecraft showing you a toast informing you of it.

**If that happens, please [open an issue](#problems) with your .minecraft/logs/latest.log file attached!**

#### Join the Discord!

If you are interested in my mods or have any questions, you can join my [Discord](https://discord.gg/B6ZV8SF672)!

#### Configure

To configure the mod, open the config screen from [ModMenu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) or go to .minecraft/config/fastquit-config.txt.

There is currently three options to configure:

**Show Toasts**:

Determines whether a toast gets shown when a world finishes saving.

**Background Thread Priority**:

Sets the thread priority of the server when saving worlds in the background.
This is done to improve client performance while saving, but will make the saving take longer over all.
Value has to be between 0 and 10, setting it to 0 will disable changing thread priority.

**Render "Saving world" Screen**:

When playing on high render distance, quitting the world can still take a bit because the client-side chunk storage has to be cleared.
By enabling this setting the "Saving world" screen will be rendered.

**Show Saving Time**

Determines whether the time it took to save the world gets displayed on toasts and the world list.
Value has to be between 0 and 2, with 0 never showing the time, 1 only on the toast and 2 also on the world list. In ModMenu these are accordingly labelled.

#### How does this mod work?

**At it's core, this mod is quite simple:**

Normally, when quitting a singleplayer world, the client will wait until the server thread has finished saving the world before going to the Title Screen.
This mod skips this waiting period and lets the server continue saving in the background.

**PLEASE NOTE** this does not always make quitting a world instant, as the client can still take a bit of time to unload rendered chunks etc. However, even in that case you will see a speedup as clientside unloading and serverside saving now perform simultaneously instead of one after the other.

**Of course in practice this is not quite that easy:**

When working with multiple threads like this, many problems arise.
For example, when going to the world list, Minecraft will try to read its level data but fails because the background saving still locks the world file.

Instead, we now access the information through the still saving server.
Similarly, when trying to edit, delete or recreate the world, we have to use the existing session.

To keep these processes thread safe, a lot of synchronization has to be done to ensure the saving server and the client don't get in each other's way.

For some things, like rejoining the still saving world or making a backup, we just wait for the server to finish saving completely.
We also wait for the worlds to finish saving when quitting the game to ensure no data is lost.

## FerriteCore

Memory usage optimizations

This mod reduces the memory usage of Minecraft in a few different ways. A high-level technical description of the changes is available [here](https://github.com/malte0811/FerriteCore/blob/main/summary.md).

The amount of memory saved will depend on the pack. In version 2.5.9 of [All Of Fabric 3](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/all-of-fabric-3) it reduces the RAM usage (heap size) from 1,792 MB to 984 MB. For comparison the same setup with Hydrogen instead of FerriteCore uses 1,335 MB.  
These values were measured after generating a world with a fixed seed and waiting for two minutes.
The project picture is a cropped version of [this](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Magnetic-core_memory,_at_angle.jpg) picture.

#### FAQ

##### Should I install this on the server or just on the client?

Some optimizations are client-side only, but there are some rather high-impact optimizations that are relevant on the server too. So you should install it on both sides.

##### Is this compatible with [other mod]?

Most likely yes. The only exception is Hydrogen, which is compatible with all recent FerriteCore versions *on Minecraft versions where Hydrogen is officially released*. This means that 1.18+ builds are not compatible with Hydrogen, since it has been officially archived and won't receive any releases on these versions.

## Happiness (is a) Warm Gun

Simple but nice gun mod


 





Inspired by the likes of Techguns, Team Fortress 2, Doom, and a few other oddities, Happiness (is a) Warm Gun is a simple-yet-detailed gun mod for Fabric 1.16/1.17/1.18/1.19. Happiness (is a) Warm Gun, or HWG, shoots for (pun intended) a pleasant, interesting-yet-not-overdetailed and simple-yet-in-depth and intuitive gun mod, to add a new class of weapons. HWG also aims for fairly simply models, all made in json, rather than overmodeled and 32x or higher assets, while still giving the player carefully modeled items. In addition, the Overworld is patrolled by gun-toting Illagers, sneaky Illager spies, and the nether is stalked by horrific Technodemons! Time to rip and tea... erm... slash and shoot... until its done.


Getting Started
First, you will want to gather a good amount of iron, gunpowder, levers, gold nuggets, and similar common ingredients. You should be able to craft a few basic firearms this way with the help of a Gun Table. In addition, weapons may drop from Merc and Spy Illagers.

 

However, you are only able to craft some of the more basic weapons, try getting a Villager interested in your Gun Table, which will turn them into a Gunsmith. They will offer some stronger and more specific weapons due to their profession.

 

However, if you still need superior firepower, one must enter the very depths of hell itself. Technodemons dot the burning wastes of the realm, and you may be able to acquire some of their weapons by slaying them.

 

And finally, a few unique weapons can only be found in loot chests.


FAQ
Q: What version is this mod for?

A: HWG is for 1.16.5+ Fabric. Last Minecraft version will be the maintained version.
 

Q: How do I craft guns?
A: You must first create a Gun Table, then gather a good amount of resources, which will allow you to make some basic firearms and ammo. After that, you can get a Villager interested in your Gun Table to make them take the Gunsmith profession, and many of the more advanced guns can be acquired though trade. However, a few weapons are only mob drops or treasure.


Q: Can I use this mod in a modpack?

A: Go right ahead! Given your modpack follows the usual ToS. I'd also ask you for the pack to be hosted on Curseforge, but I won't stop you if you want to include it in a Technic pack or similar.


Q: Can I include this mod in a showcase or let's play?

A: Of course! Also, if you do decide to do a review on this mod, please shoot me a link!


Q: Will you backport/port to Forge?

A: No to both. I would also please ask you to not port this mod to Forge either. In addition, we will not backport to any earlier versions of Fabric.

## Indium

Sodium addon providing support for the Fabric Rendering API, based on Indigo

Indium is an addon for the rendering optimisation mod [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium), providing support for the Fabric Rendering API. The Fabric Rendering API is required for many mods that use advanced rendering effects, and is currently not supported by Sodium directly. Indium is based upon the reference implementation Indigo, which is part of Fabric API with source available [here](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric/tree/1.17/fabric-renderer-indigo). (licensed Apache 2.0)

## Frequently Asked Questions
### Which mods require Indium?
Any mod that uses the Fabric Rendering API will require Indium when used with Sodium. These include: Campanion, Bits and Chisels, LambdaBetterGrass,
Continuity, Packages, and many more. Some of these mods may function without an implementation of the Fabric Rendering API, but have broken textures and models.

### Does Indium affect performance?
Indium's impact on performance should be negligible, however mods that use the Fabric Rendering API could themselves impact performance. Indium will not provide a performance benefit over using only Sodium.

### Is Indium a replacement for Sodium?
No, Indium is an addon mod for Sodium - you must use both mods together to get Fabric Rendering API support with Sodium's rendering optimisations.

### Do I need Indium if I don't use Sodium?
No, Indigo is provided as part of Fabric API as the reference implementation of the Fabric Rendering API. Indigo disables itself when Sodium is installed.

### Is Fabric API required?
Yes. To use Sodium with mods that require the Fabric Rendering API, you need *both* Fabric API to provide the rendering API and Indium to implement the rendering API.

### Will it be merged into Sodium?
Fabric Rendering API support is not currently a priority for the Sodium developers, and will not be explored until Sodium is in a more stable state.

### Which versions of Sodium are supported?
Sodium 0.2.0 or newer is required for all versions of Indium. I support the latest stable versions of Sodium for 1.18 and 1.19. Iris may not always be compatible with the latest release or build of Indium - please ask the Iris support channels if you have issues.

## Isometric Renders

Creates high-resolution isometric screenshots of game objects

![Header](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/844546884704927774/989531797656326144/isometric_header.png)
Isometric Renders allows you to take isometric screenshots, or rather, create renders of game objects like parts of world, blocks, items and entities.

These are automatically keyed to have a transparent background and you can adjust scale, positioning and many more options right in-game in a fancy gui.

This was designed with modded wikis or similar documentation in mind, should be easy to use and mostly pretty performant.

In-Depth documentation is available on https://docs.wispforest.io/isometric-renders/home/
***
🌟 **Currently Supported Rendering Targets** 🌟
- Items
- Blocks
- Entities
- Areas of the world
- Batch export of multiple blocks or items
- Item Atlases (Overviews)

The basic command is **/isorender**

## Krypton

A mod to optimize the Minecraft networking stack

### Warning

**Krypton is a work-in-progress.** I do not provide any guarantees about its stability, compatibility with other mods, or support for every possible setup out there. Support for this mod is provided on a "best-effort" basis. This is not my day job, it is a hobby growing out of related work I've done.

### Sponsor Me!

Did this mod make your server playable? [Chip in a bit of money](https://github.com/sponsors/astei) so I can continue developing it.

### What's Krypton?

Krypton (from Ancient Greek _kryptos_, "the hidden one") is a Fabric mod that attempts to optimize the Minecraft networking stack. It derives from work
done in the [Velocity](https://velocitypowered.com/) and [Tuinity](https://github.com/Spottedleaf/Tuinity)
projects.

Krypton contains several optimizations, including:

* **Highly optimized Netty handlers** derived from the [Velocity](https://velocitypowered.com) proxy, which I am the developer of. These handlers have sen real-world usage and extensive profiling, and strategically deploy native code where it makes the most sense.
* **Flush consolidation** to lower server CPU usage (and reducing the impact from hardware security vulnerabilities which exploit speculative execution) and lower server tick times.
* **Micro-optimizations** to reduce memory usage and improve packet serialization speeds.

[Please join my Discord](https://discord.gg/RUGArxEQ8J) to discuss the mod or get support.

### Compatibility

Krypton should work anywhere where a Minecraft can run &mdash; naturally, however, it is tuned for Linux.

I try to ensure that Krypton will work with the Fabric API, Lithium, and Sodium. Support beyond these mods is provided on a best effort basis.

You can't see a lot in the darkness, you wish you had a torch,
or a lantern to hold and see in the light...

And this is now possible with this mod as it adds dynamic lights to the game.
You can see in the darkness thanks to your torch now!

This mod adds dynamic lights to Minecraft. Dynamic lights are lights created by an entity holding an
item which makes light as a block, or created by an entity on fire, etc.

### 📖 Usage

Using this mod is very simple!

Install it in your mods folder along with [Fabric API] and [ModMenu], (and [Sodium] if wanted for better performances).

You will notice nothing at first but if you go into the video options or into the settings screen of the mod via [ModMenu], you will notice an option called Dynamic Lights which is by default off, choose the wanted configuration and enjoy!
You can also configure the mod by editing the file in `config/lambdynlights.toml`.

## LazyDFU

Makes the game boot faster by deferring non-essential initialization

LazyDFU is an optimization mod for Minecraft that defers unnecessary initialization work so that it is only performed if required. Specifically, it makes the initialization of DataFixerUpper "lazy" - that is, it will not immediately create the rules required to migrate data from older versions of Minecraft to newer versions until it actually needs to do so.

**This mod is for Fabric/Quilt**

### Compatibility

LazyDFU 0.1.2 is compatible with Minecraft 1.14 through 1.18.2, and works on the client and server side.

LazyDFU 0.1.3 is compatible with Minecraft 1.19 and above, however Mojang now implements the functionality LazyDFU provides on the server side. The client still initializes all DFU rules by default, so LazyDFU hooks into the native client functionality that enables DFU rule baking and turns it into a no-op.

### Sponsor me!

Did this mod make Minecraft playable for you? [Chip in a bit of money](https://github.com/sponsors/astei) so I can continue developing it.

### Why does it work?

DataFixerUpper (often abbreviated to DFU) is the Minecraft component responsible for handling world upgrades from older versions of Minecraft to newer versions. DFU is initialized very early in the Minecraft startup process - in fact, it's initialized before the game window even appears. It is laughably overengineered and very slow, but it's what Mojang gives us to work with.

As part of the DFU initialization process, it caches rules required to convert from older versions to MInecraft through every version in between, up to the version of the game being launched. This process takes place in the background, but it is _extremely_ slow, as it is both CPU and memory intensive. With Minecraft 1.16.5, I have measured this process take 9 seconds on a Ryzen 9 3900X desktop (a high-end desktop CPU released in 2019) and 57 seconds on a laptop with an i5-8250U (a mid-range laptop chip from 2017).

All LazyDFU does is stop this process - it lets DFU initialize, but it will force it to not cache all these rules. As a result, the DFU rules are only compiled when a world needs to be converted. This means it is possible you may see lag spikes if LazyDFU forces the game to compile migration rules, but once complete there is no performance penalty.

### Prove it to me

I [recorded a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXDqJ598kKA) that shows you how effective LazyDFU is.

### Comparing it to other mods

In comparison to other mods, LazyDFU has the primary advantage of being _simple_, _safe_, and having _low impact_ on the game.

* LazyDFU is a very simple mod. The entire mod is about a dozen lines of code, about as uncomplicated as a mod can get, while still delivering huge benefits. (This means it's also an ideal mod to use to experiment with a new Mixin platform!)
* LazyDFU is highly compatible and safe. LazyDFU is extremely unlikely to conflict with other mods. This mod is based on a similar patch in [Paper](https://papermc.io) that had been in use for over a year with no reported issues with migrating to newer versions of Minecraft. (Paper has since changed to replacing Mojang's data fixers with a highly optimized implementation of its own.)

## Legendary Tooltips

Give your rare items a fancier tooltip! Also adds additional tooltip configuration options.

Ever feel like item tooltips are a little lackluster?&nbsp;&nbsp;Legendary Tooltips is here to change that.

This mod will allow you to change the tooltips of a selection of items of your choice to embellished works of art.&nbsp; It also adds a host of other tooltip options including centered item names, tooltip shadows, matching tooltip borders to item colors, separators under item names, 3d item previews, compact tooltips, and more!
&nbsp;
This mod requires Iceberg, you can download it here.Versions 1.3 and up require Prism, you can download it here.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Client / Server
This mod is fully client-side.
&nbsp;
Configuration
Extensive configuration instructions can be found here.&nbsp; Please read this first!
&nbsp;
Players

The configuration file includes instructions for setting up tooltips however you feel fit, please read the configuration instructions first!&nbsp; Supports up to sixteen custom borders, each of which can be set to apply to items by name, mod, tag, vanilla rarity, item name color, display name, tooltip text, or NBT tag.&nbsp; By default, the mod includes the custom border seen above, and more can easily be added with a resource pack.&nbsp; For an example resource pack that adds ten custom frames, check out Eclectic Trove!

&nbsp;
Mod authors

The following only applies to version 1.2 and later!
If you are interested in adding custom borders to items in a mod you are coding, it is possible by adding Legendary Tooltips as a dependency.&nbsp; (Use cursemaven.com for this.)
Use the LegendaryTooltipsConfig.addFrameDefinition() method to specify a list of selectors for a given ResourceLocation / frame index (see configuration file documentation if you don't understand what this means).&nbsp; This method is not widely supported, so if it isn't working, please try the preferred data-driven method below instead.

&nbsp;
Resource pack authors

Borders can be customized via resource packs.&nbsp; The resource pack is capable of replacing the default border included in the mod with up to 16 custom borders that can be used by the mod.&nbsp; Please see&nbsp;Eclectic Trove&nbsp;for an example--I recommend using this as a starting point when designing your own borders.&nbsp; There is also a template image available to make drawing easier, which can be found here&nbsp;(this is a Photoshop project, so you will need Photoshop or an image editor that can read Photoshop files like Gimp).
&nbsp;
The following only applies to version 1.2 and later!
As of version 1.2, it is also possible for resource packs and mods to define custom borders using a .json file resource included in the pack/mod itself.&nbsp; This file is loaded differently than normal resources, as they do not replace each other--all border definitions found in all active custom border resource files will be loaded and applied.&nbsp; These files allow you to use&nbsp;any properly-formatted image resource and can specify all colors to match.&nbsp; An example file that describes the file format can be found here.&nbsp; Please read this file first, as it contains a lot of information.&nbsp; You can also find an example in the noconfig variant of Eclectic Trove, which contains definitions for many vanilla items, here.&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;
Compatibility
Highly compatible, this mod doesn't change the underlying tooltip behavior, only adds on.&nbsp; Also integrates with Equipment Compare&nbsp;to provide even fancier comparison tooltips! (See images for an example)
If you find some sort of compatibility issue, please let me know!
&nbsp;
You are free to use this mod in modpacks.

## Lithium

No-compromises game logic/server optimization mod

Lithium is a modern, general-purpose optimization mod for Minecraft which works to improve a number of systems (game physics, mob AI, block ticking, etc) with the goal of **not changing any vanilla mechanics**. 



The mod works **on both the client and server**, and can be installed on servers **without requiring clients to also have the mod** (and vice versa.)



For multiplayer servers, administrators can expect a sizeable improvement to tick times, allowing their hardware to support more loaded entities, chunks, and players. Even in single-player, Lithium helps to improve performance by optimizing the internal game server, which is used for "ticking" the world. This can free up your computer's processor to focus on other tasks, resulting in **improved frame rates and increased responsiveness**. 





The strict goal of maintaining exact behavior with vanilla makes Lithium suitable for almost any Minecraft server running Fabric, even for highly complex gameplay scenarios and creations. In fact, our continued insistence towards not changing vanilla gameplay has even led to the mod being officially allowed in [Minecraft speedrunning](https://www.speedrun.com/mc).



### Installation

Make sure you have the latest version of Fabric Loader present and then simply drop the mod into your mods folder. No other mods or additional setup (not even Fabric API!) is required. You do not need to create new worlds in order to take advantage of the mod.




While you're at it, you may want to check out two of my other mods, [Phosphor](https://modrinth.com/mod/phosphor) and [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium), as they're both fully compatible and only help to further improve performance in different parts of the game.



### Configuration

Lithium makes use of an semi-unusual configuration system which allows you to enable or completely disable patches the mod applies. This system allows fine-grained control over what code in Minecraft is modified by Lithium, and as such, can be used to completely eliminate bugs or mod incompatibilities introduced by the mod.



For more information, please read [the wiki entry](https://github.com/jellysquid3/lithium-fabric/wiki/Configuration-File) on modifying your configuration file.



Please note: An empty configuration file is *perfectly normal* and just means you want to use the default options, which are already set up out of the box for the best performance the mod can offer.

## Model Gap Fix

Fixes gaps in Block Models and Item Models

Model Gap FIX

 

This is a simple client mod that fixes https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-73186

which affects both Block Models and Item Models and possibly other models too

 

The mod works by removing texture zooming, making every model face use 100% of its texture, unlike of what it did previoulsly.

Thisnot only fixes this bugs on items (where it's most noticeable) but with block models too and everything else that might use those functions.

 

This issue was especially noticeable with custom block models or some 2d items.

 

 

Q&A:

- Will this slow down my game? 

Not at all! Removing texture zooming just removes some code and has no impact. If you however want to be nit picky the mod also slightly tweaks item models in a way that could add a ouple more quads for concave item textures compared to vanilla so in that case it could very slightly worse that vanilla. This is however negligible and could only be an issue when trying to run high resolution packs

- How does this work?

The base fix is simply removing texture zooming. This is extremly simple to do and immediately "fixes up" all those problematic gaps on models.
For 2d item models something else is needed as this alone creates another kind of tiny gaps in them due to the way they are generated, quad by quad. These are very tiny and they flicker so I had to fix those too. To do so I've changed the item model generator to never create a quad that encompasses a transparent pixel and instead create multiple quads for each row of solid pixel in the same direction. This allows me to slightly increase the size of all these side quads without creating new gaps in the process, thus covering all gaps seamlessly. Note that this last part only applies to forge as fabric does not seem to have such tiny lines and the models work right away with no extra quad

## Mouse Tweaks

Enhances inventory management by adding various functions to the mouse buttons. 

Mouse Tweaks replaces the standard RMB dragging mechanic, adds two new LMB dragging mechanics and an ability to quickly move items with the scroll wheel.

### Installation

1.16.5 and later: install Minecraft Forge or Fabric.

1.14.4 and later: install Minecraft Forge.

1.12.2 and earlier: install either Minecraft Forge or LiteLoader (or both).

Put the Mouse Tweaks jar-file into the mods folder in your .minecraft directory.



[**Mouse Tweaks API**](https://github.com/YaLTeR/MouseTweaks/tree/master/src/main/java/yalter/mousetweaks/api)



Configuration file: `.minecraft/config/MouseTweaks.cfg`

### Tweaks

#### RMB Tweak

Very similar to the standard RMB dragging mechanic, with one difference: if you drag over a slot multiple times, an item will be put there multiple times. Replaces the standard mechanic if enabled.

**Configuration setting:** `RMBTweak=1`

Hold your right mouse button:

![](https://i.imgur.com/Uo7xF.png)

Drag your mouse around the crafting grid:

![](https://i.imgur.com/NCRED.png)

You can drag your mouse on top of existing items:

![](https://i.imgur.com/6MQv6.png)

#### LMB Tweak (with item)

Lets you quickly pick up or move items of the same type.

**Configuration setting:** `LMBTweakWithItem=1`

Hold your left mouse button to pick up an item:

![](https://i.imgur.com/ziuGG.png?1)

Drag your mouse across the inventory. Items of the same type will be picked up:

![](https://i.imgur.com/JDjsE.png?2)

Hold shift and drag. Items of the same type will get "shift-clicked":

![](https://i.imgur.com/YrvmT.png?2)

#### LMB Tweak (without item)

Quickly move items into another inventory.

**Configuration setting:** `LMBTweakWithoutItem=1`

Hold shift, then hold your left mouse button:

*(Mouse cursor is not visible for some reason)*

Drag your mouse across the inventory. Items will get "shift-clicked":

*(Mouse cursor is not visible for some reason)*

![](https://i.imgur.com/qBu6k.png?2)

#### Wheel Tweak

Scroll to quickly move items between inventories. When you scroll down on an item stack, its items will be moved one by one. When you scroll up, items will be moved into it from another inventory.

**Configuration setting:** `WheelTweak=1`

**Configuration setting:** `WheelSearchOrder=1`

When you scroll up, the mod will search for items from last to first (when this is set to 1) or from first to last (when this is set to 0).

**Configuration setting:** `WheelScrollDirection=0`

Set this to 1 to invert the default scroll actions. So, when set to 1, scrolling down will pull the items and scrolling up will push the items.

Set this to 2 to enable the inventory position aware scrolling. Scrolling up will push the items into the other inventory if it's above the selected slot, or pull items from the other inventory if it's below the selected slot. Vice versa for scrolling down.

#### Obsolete / Removed Settings

These settings existed in older Mouse Tweaks versions but were removed since.

**Configuration setting:** `OnTickMethodOrder=Forge, LiteLoader`

Mouse Tweaks can use multiple APIs for an OnTick method that it requires. You can use this setting to control the API it prefers. This shouldn't really matter at all. If a method isn't supported (for example, you don't have the API installed) the mod will proceed to check the next ones.

**Configuration setting:** `ScrollHandling=0`

Toggles between "smooth scrolling, minor issues" (0) and "non-smooth scrolling, no issues" (1). When set to smooth scrolling, minor issues may be experienced such as scrolling "through" JEI or other mods. When set to non-smooth scrolling, those issues will not happen, but the scrolling will be a little non-smooth. Non-smooth scrolling works only with the Forge OnTick method.

This option is set to smooth scrolling by default because the aforementioned issues require rather specific conditions to trigger and aren't very impactful, while scrolling items is something you do all the time and want the experience to be as good as possible.

### Compatibility

Mouse Tweaks is compatible with everything based on `GuiContainer` (as long as the behavior isn't changed too much).

If your GUI isn't based on `GuiContainer`, or if you want to improve compatibility (making Mouse Tweaks ignore some slot, for example), take a look at the [API documentation](https://github.com/YaLTeR/MouseTweaks/blob/2dc5bb108c2663f9a07b3a181483733a0274b41a/src/api/java/yalter/mousetweaks/api/IMTModGuiContainer3.java).

### Modpacks

Feel free to include Mouse Tweaks in modpacks.

## Mouse Wheelie

A "small" clientside mod featuring item scrolling, inventory sorting, item refilling and more!

A small clientside mod to enable various mouse wheel related actions. Features item scrolling, inventory sorting, item refilling and much more!

---

_No mouses were harmed in the making of this mod._

---

This mod embeds parts of [Amecs](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/amecs). It uses Amecs' API so you'll notice utility features like modifier keys on keybindings.

---



### Disclaimer
**I only maintain this site, CurseForge and the GitHub source site. All other websites distributing the mod are not owned/affiliated with me and might publish incorrect or outdated mod files or even worse malware.**

### Current features

* When hovering over items you can scroll up and down to send single items up and down.
  * When holding _shift_ alongside you may send whole stacks of items.
  * When holding _control_ alongside you can move all stacks of the same type of item.
  * When you're in scrollable inventories you might want to press _alt_ to prevent scrolling items.
* When you're sending items via shift-leftclick you can now hold both buttons to send all stacks you're hovering over
* Hold alt-leftclick to drop items quickly.
* When you're in the creative inventory and hover over the tab icons you can scroll through all the creative tabs and pages.
* In your facourite recipe books you can:
  * hover over the recipe grid to scroll through the pages.
  * hover over the recipe group tabs to scroll through them.
* Sort inventories by clicking with your mouse wheel (you can also define an own keybinding)
  * sorts by raw id (will most likely group by mods and similar items)
  * hold _shift_ while clicking to sort by quantity
  * hold _control_ while clicking to sort by alphabet
  * You can customize which sort modes you prefer
* Press the swap key in any inventory to swap with the offhand
* Let your slots be automagically refilled from your inventory!
* Pick the matching tools for blocks by either sneaking while picking the block or by holding a tool. (this is configurable)
* Right-click trades or recipes to directly apply the crafting. When holding shift it will craft/trade a full stack
* Also: Armor switch if MW is installed on the server-side 🙂

### Configuration
Lots of stuff is configurable. To open the config screen you'll need to install [Mod Menu](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/modmenu).

### Limitations
Since this mod is completely clientside item scrolling might be a bit laggy on hard-working servers.


This mod will not work in *Applied Energistics 2* screens and inventories. AE2 handles inventory screens even more strangely than Mojang handles creative inventories, so don't expect any fixes from my side!

To make you aware of this MW declares a conflict with AE2 which will show up in the log. This incompatibility only applies to certain mods and all other inventories will work fine.

### Before Version 1.3.4
There are bugs in Tweed (library used by Mouse Wheelie) and Artifice (library of Extra Pieces) which make these mods incompatible when bundled within other mods.

To make Mouse Wheelie work with Extra Pieces please install the latest version of Tweed alongside!

With version 1.3.4 this bug has been fixed in Tweed and my other library mods - so no more incompatibilities from my side. Currently this bug still persists in Artifice so other mods might still be incompatible with Extra Pieces and all derivatives of Artifice.

## No Chat Reports

Makes chat unreportable (where possible)

## No Chat Reports

   

This mod strips cryptographic signatures that since 1.19 are attached to every message sent in the chat. Removing them makes it impossible to track and associate your chat messages with your Minecraft and, by extension, Microsoft account.

**As of 1.19.1, it also disables Player Chat Reporting.**

Please notice that, while I am aware of [Guardian](https://github.com/nodusclient/guardian) and certain other exploits that allow you to counteract reporting system on client against the will of the server, I am consciously choosing to not integrate them as part of this mod. No Chat Reports will remain effective on client side only if given server allows it to be. If you do not like servers that enforce chat signing and fully support chat reporting - I advise to simply not play on them.

Also, while there are many plugins out there that "borrow" the name and even icon of my mod, please be aware that **I have not authored any of them** and cannot say how well they do their job.
 
### Installation and Use:

This mod supports both Forge and Fabric, just download the version for respective modloader. It can be installed on either client, server, or both sides, and will function differently depending on which sides it is present at:

**1. Only Client:** Client will refuse to send account's public key to the server, and signatures will be stripped from the messages that you send. This way it won't be useful to try and report your messages, as there will be no proof they were actually sent from your account. Server will relay them unless `enforce-secure-profile` option is set to true in server options (which it is by default since 1.19.1), in which case you will not be able to join, unless you agree to send signed messages (the mod will supply warning screen);

**2. Only Server:** Clients will still attach signatures when sending messages to the server, but server will strip them before relaying them to other players. This way chat reporting will not work for any players that join. You can enable player to system message conversion in config, to prevent players without the mod from seeing them as "Not Secure"

**3. Both Client and Server:** Signature will be stripped on client side before sending messages to server, server will make no attempt to verify message signatures. Chat reporting and "Only Show Secure Chat" will not function, and players will be notified that those features are disabled by the mod when trying to use them.

Although the mod can function when present on only one of the sides, it can be configured to demand itself to be installed on another side in order to play. This way you can install it on server and require all clients that join to have this mod in order to have full functionality, but can also leave it server-only if you prefer. Configuration files are located in NoChatReports subfolder of default config folder.

Additionally, if installed on client, this mod will disable telemetry (similarly to how [No Telemetry](https://modrinth.com/mod/no-telemetry) does).

To make Velocity compatible with this mod, set `force-key-authentication = false` in `velocity.toml`. Thanks to [MrMelon54](https://github.com/MrMelon54) for pointing this out.

### Chat Encryption
I have put together a video dedicated to chat encryption, you can watch it to learn how to use it (and whether you should): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7RzNP32k-s

### Documentation:
You can find documentation and other information relevant to this mod on the [wiki](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/). It currently features following articles:
- [Configuration Files](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/Configuration-Files/)
- [Protecting Server Players](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/Protecting-Server-Players/)
- [How to Get Safe Server Status](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/How-to-Get-Safe-Server-Status)
- [I Got Banned!](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/I-Got-Banned)
- [To Encrypt or Not to Encrypt](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/To-Encrypt-or-Not-To-Encrypt)
- [The Realms Question](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/The-Realms-Question)


### For Developers:
If you develop your own mod, plugin or other server software that in some way prevents chat reports, you can make No Chat Reports on client recognize servers with your software as safe. I wrote [a small article about this](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/How-to-Get-Safe-Server-Status). For clarification or further inquiries - contact me via Discord, link in "External resources".

### Reasoning:
See my videos for an explanation of how message signatures and chat reporting work in the game, their failures and the reasoning behind the creation of this mod:

## Not Enough Animations

Bringing first-person animations to the third-person

## Not Enough Animations 

This mod brings a lot of missing third-person animations from the first-person or modifies them to be better representative to how they should look like or look like in the first-person. This mod was created as an expansion for the [First-Person Mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/first-person-model), but works completely on its own and is fully vanilla/3rd party server compatible(since it's all just visual).

#### All features can be enabled/disabled individually in an ingame config screen! (Accessible via the ModList/ModMenu)

Added/fixed animations:

- Eating/Drinking

![](https://tr7zw.dev/nea/eating.png)
![](https://tr7zw.dev/nea/drinking.png)

- Maps(Yes you can see the map content if your client has been sent the map by holding it once/seeing it in an item frame)

![](https://tr7zw.dev/nea/maps1.PNG)
![](https://tr7zw.dev/nea/maps2.PNG)

- Shield placement(you block where you look, not where the body is rotated to. So this will rotate the body with the head while blocking)

![](https://tr7zw.dev/nea/shield.png)

- Don't show items during two-handed animations(Hide the offhand item while using a bow/crossbow)

![](https://tr7zw.dev/nea/twoHands.PNG)

- Boat rowing(No longer sitting there and staring at the self-moving Paddles)

![](https://tr7zw.dev/nea/boat.png)

- Horses(at least act like you're holding the reins)

![](https://tr7zw.dev/nea/horse.png)

- Looking at a compass/clock(this one is actually more eye candy for the First-person Mod to make the compass better usable, but won't hurt outside of that, can be modified in the config file to extend to more items)

![](https://tr7zw.dev/nea/compass.PNG)

- Ladder/climbing animation

![](https://tr7zw.dev/nea/ladder.gif)

- Crawling animation, replacing the swimming one while out of water

![](https://tr7zw.dev/nea/crawling.gif)

- Smooth arm movement and transitions

- Scabbard Sword while not in use

## OptiGUI

A client side drop-in replacement for OptiFine custom GUIs

## OptiGUI

A client side drop-in replacement for OptiFine custom GUIs.

This mod supports most OptiFine GUI resource packs. I didn't do an extensive test with the .properties files, because I couldn't find such a resource pack.
If a resource pack does not work or works differently than using OptiFine, please open an issue.

### Development future

OptiGUI is being rewritten from scratch in Kotlin, as originally intended. The new codebase will support extensions from other mods, and will support all currently supported Minecraft versions in one single jar file. This involved many experiments. This makes it easier to maintain support for multiple Minecraft versions. The new codebase already supports a subset of OptiFine features, and will be availiable [here](https://github.com/opekope2/OptiGUI-Next). The existing issues will be fixed in the new codebase, and I have plans to add support for even more container GUI (including [chest boats](https://github.com/opekope2/OptiGUI/issues/25)).

If you're an average user or a modpack developer, I don't recommend using the future alpha builds. However, if you'd like to help me catch bugs, feel free to try it.

### How do I use it

1. Download and install [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/use)
2. Download [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) and put it in your mods folder
3. Download this mod from [GitHub releases](https://github.com/opekope2/OptiGUI/releases), [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/optigui/versions), or [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/optigui/files)
4. Put this mod in your mods folder

### Supported resource packs

* [Colourful Containers](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/colourful-containers-gui/)
* [Colourful Containers Add-On](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/updated-colourful-containers-light-mode-gui-optifine-required/)
* [Colourful Containers Dark Mode](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/colourful-containers-dark-mode-gui-optifine-required/)
* [Animated RGB GUI](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/optifine-animated-rgb-gui) ¹
* [NEON20 ANIMATED](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/neon20-animated-optifine/)
* [Rybo's Enhanced GUI](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/rybo-s-enhanced-gui/)

¹ see FAQ for animation support

This list is not exhaustive. If you know a resource pack which works, please open an issue. If you know a resource pack which does not work, but works with OptiFine, please open an issue.

### Partially supported resource packs

* [Advanced GUI](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/custom-gui/) ¹
* [New Default+](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/newdefaultplus) ²

¹ Color shulker boxes, Ender chests and Villager Professions do not work. The resource pack does not include OptiFine-specific assets, and these features are not supported by OptiGUI. (Some mods (Colourful Containers) include assets for these features and work with OptiGUI)

² Barrel does not work, neither does it work with OptiFine. The resource pack does not specify it according to the format.

### Mods with incompatibilities

These mods are known to have issues with OptiGUI. Unless noted otherwise, these mods **can** be loaded alongside OptiGUI, but interfere with this mod's functionality.

* [Litematica Printer](https://modrinth.com/mod/litematica-printer) - print mode resets any open GUI texture. Reopening the GUI fixes the texture. [#15](https://github.com/opekope2/OptiGUI/issues/15)

### Resource pack format

See [OptiFine docs](https://optifine.readthedocs.io/custom_guis.html).

This mod supports some additional GUIs which are not (yet) supported by OptiFine. These start with an underscore (`_`) to minimize the chance of an incompatibility with an upcoming OptiFine update.

#### `container` additions:

* `container` accepts the following additional types: `_cartography_table, _grindstone, _loom, _smithing_table, _stonecutter` to replace the GUI of a cartography table, grindstone, loom, smithing table, or stonecutter, respectively.

#### `container=chest` additions:

* `_barrel=`: replace the GUI of a barrel.

#### `container=furnace` additions:

* `variants` accepts the following values: `_furnace, _blast, _blast_furnace, _smoker` to replace the GUI of a furnace, blast furnace (2x), or smoker, respectively.

#### `container=villager` additions:

* `professions` additionally accepts the value `_wandering_trader` to replace the GUI of a wandering trader.

### Currently broken features

* Custom name matching in .properties [#19](https://github.com/opekope2/OptiGUI/issues/19)
  * This has been broken for a while
  * Workaround: Use [Know My Name](https://modrinth.com/mod/know-my-name) server-side mod

### Does this mod affect game performance?

#### v0.1.0-v1.1.1

Yes, to a high extent.

The code is absolutely not optimized, the mod queries the last interacted block or entity multiple times per rendered frame, for every non-block texture rendered.

Please do not use these versions.

#### v1.1.2-v1.1.3

Yes, to an estimated moderately high extent.

Introduced caching, but still queries the last interacted block or entity at least once per rendered frame, for every non-block texture rendered.

Please do not use these versions.

#### v1.1.4

Yes, to an estimated moderate extent.

While all optimizations planned for v1.1.2 have been implemented, further optimizations will be implemented soon.

Caches are updated after every game tick instead of every rendered texture, but some code paths do not use the cache.

#### v1.1.5+

Not much, or to an estimated low extent.

All code paths (except for villager and llama matcher) use cache now.

### FAQ

#### Can I use this mod in a modpack?

Yes, the license allows that.

The mod is included in the [Fabulously Optimized](https://modrinth.com/modpack/fabulously-optimized) modpack.

#### Does this mod support OptiFine GUI animations?

Not by itself, please check out [Animatica](https://modrinth.com/mod/animatica). Supported as of OptiGUI v0.2.0.

#### Does this mod support OptiFine colors (colors.properties)?

No, see [Colormatic](https://modrinth.com/mod/colormatic).

#### Does this mod have a configuration GUI/file?

No. Just load a resource pack and it works out-of-the-box.

#### Does this mod work with Sodium?

Yes. As of 2022-09-08, Sodium does not interfere with OptiGUI. If Sodium introduces a change which breaks OptiGUI, please open an issue.

#### What loaders are supported?

* Fabric is supported.
* Fabric derivates like Quilt are not supported, it may or may not work, feel free to try it.
* Forge is not supported.
* Other loaders are not supported.

## Pack It Up!

A simple backpack mod aimed to provide interesting progression options and simple upgradeability. Choose from a variety of themed packs that hold a ton of certain specific items!

![Main Banner for Pack It Up!](https://i.imgur.com/8Q8XWs7.png)

### What is Pack It Up!?

Pack it up is a simple backpack mod that focuses on storage choices over a simple progression from small backpack to humongous backpack. There are tiers of basic pack, but there is also an array of specialized backpacks tuned towards certain item types, that can hold much more of that type of item.

[![Discord Link](https://i.imgur.com/iXATO6K.png)](https://discord.gg/Fnw2UbE72x)

### Packs

|Pack|Name|Description|
|---|---|---|
|![](https://i.imgur.com/jsGv5sP.png)|Backpack|Your run of the mill pack. Holds 2 rows of any item.|
|![](https://i.imgur.com/7bNCT8I.png)|Large Backpack|Larger basic pack. Holds 4 rows of items. All specialized packs derive from this.|
|![](https://i.imgur.com/hRZj1Mv.png)|Extreme Backpack|High Tier basic pack. Hold 6 rows of stuff.|
|![](https://i.imgur.com/jIJODvp.png)|Iron Armorpack|Small armorpack. Can be worn in the chest slot and provides 3 armor|
|![](https://i.imgur.com/SiR3vk5.png)|Golden Armorpack|Medium armorpack. Can be worn in the chest slot and provides 4 armor|
|![](https://i.imgur.com/e4idS43.png)|Netherite Armorpack|High tier armorpack. Can be worn in the chest slot and provides 6 armor and 2 armor toughness|

|![](https://i.imgur.com/2ACpLBy.png)|Orepack|Like the blockpack, but can only hold ore blocks, raw ores, and gems. Stacks to 256.|
|![](https://i.imgur.com/DDWtP5A.png)|Enderpack|A portable ender chest. Links to the players normal ender chest inventory.|
|![](https://i.imgur.com/mLenyjY.png)|Cactuspack|A portable trash can. Voids items that have been put into it when the GUI closes.|
|![](https://i.imgur.com/dwyRzsf.png)|Plantpack|Holds 3 rows of flowers, saplings, logs, and other planty things. Stacks hold 256 items.|
|![](https://i.imgur.com/ep5VQLF.png)|Magicpack|Holds 3 rows of Enchanted books, potions, and tipped arrows. Can hold up to 256 items, or 4x an items normal limit.|
|![](https://i.imgur.com/6uOyfeh.png)|Lunchpack|Holds 3 rows of food items. Up to 256 per stack.|
|![](https://i.imgur.com/xr6l29f.png)|Toolpack|Holds 7 rows of tools and equipment. Anything that can be damaged.|

### Getting Started
To get started, craft a _Pack Bench_ with some planks and some ladders (same layout as the smithing table recipe). The Pack Bench GUI also looks very much like a smithing table.

Craft up a _Frame_, as described in the [wiki](https://github.com/fzzyhmstrs/piu/wiki/), and a _Backpack Bag_. Combine them in the table and viola! Your first basic pack. More advanced packs are combined with a more basic pack and the new bag, rather than a frame. You get to keep the old bag!

## Presence Footsteps

..An Overly complicated Sound Mod...

_..An Overly complicated Sound Mod..._

---

This is the continuation of Huricaaan (Ha3)'s original mod, maintained and updated to the latest version of Minecraft. All previous features have been restored and some new ones added, with new development promised for the future on the opensource github profile!

---

Expect to see a more rich and immersive Minecraft world, one where Presence Footsteps adds new and more dynamic sounds for every block the player walks on. Every block has its own material assigned to it, and can make their own, customized sounds to better match what they're made of.

---

- Wooden chests are creaky and old,
- stone is dusty and rough.
- Piston heads sound like wood, whilst their bodies are stone,
- even cake sounds like you might destroy if you step in the frosting!
- Tall grass and bristles make a dry, rustling sound as you step through them,
- Magma sounds like it's literally cooking your souls!

---

Not only that, but the latest version includes step sounds for certain non-block entities:

---

Shulkers make the same creaky box noises as Shulker boxes, boats sound like wood, and armour stands creak and produce a stone stepping sound as you walk on their stone slab base.

 ---

Presence Footsteps is also [**fully customisable**](https://github.com/Sollace/Presence-Footsteps/wiki/Information-for-Resourcepack-Creators) using resourcepacks! Modders and users can assign their own materials, sounds, and stance to blocks and entities.

## Puzzle

Adds resourcepack features and a GUI to more conveniently configure OptiFine alternatives.



Context: OptiFine was a big part of Minecraft modding for a long time and has been causing errors with mods this entire time, it's closed source nature making it especially hard to work with as a mod developer. For that reason, a lot of alternatives have been created. But usually they only replicate one specific feature of OptiFine, meaning the user has to install a lot of mods and configure them by searching for the specific mod in ModMenu.

The first problem is relatively easy to solve, by either downloading a modpack such as OpalFab&nbsp;or Fabulously Optimized or using Lambda's fantastic list of alternative mods
Puzzle was created to solve the latter by providing a united config for OptiFine replacement mods, built-in support for the most relevant alternatives and a API for other mods to take advantage of.
Due to many OptiFine features still having no replacement mod, Puzzle also adds certain OptiFine features on it's own, like resourcepack-provided splash screens
We also offer some new, innovative features to resourcepack developers, such as unlocked rotation values and bigger size for JSON-models. The configuration screen can be found in the vanilla options screen, as well as ModMenu. &lrm;


&nbsp;&thinsp; Currently, there is included support for the following mods:

Cull Leaves
Iris
Continuity
LambDynamicLights
LambdaBetterGrass
CITResewn
Custom Entity Models
Entity Texture Features

## WHAT IS REPURPOSED STRUCTURES?


Repurposed Structures is a mod about taking existing vanilla features and structures and creating new variants or modifications to them! Originally, most of the structures and features in this mod was actually made for my Ultra Amplified Dimension mod. but then I realized these features and structures would look great in the Overworld as well so I decided to take those structures and features and split them into their own mod and continue to add MORE biome variants of vanilla structures! And over time, some other people even help contribute more vanilla styled structures!



Check out the wiki below for all the info! It is kept up to date on latest Repurposed Structures releases.

**[https://github.com/TelepathicGrunt/RepurposedStructures/wiki](https://github.com/TelepathicGrunt/RepurposedStructures/wiki)**

### **🏠 HOW CAN I CONFIGURE THIS MOD? 🏠**


1.18.2 and newer info:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**As of 1.18.2 and newer, most of Repurposed Structures can be changed by datapack now. Including turning off or on structures or changing spawnrates. Click the below link to get an example datapack to edit and some pointers for what to edit to turn off structures. There's a huge amount of stuff you can change by datapack though such as changing what height RS Mineshafts spawn at or how large RS villages are and much more that was not configurable in 1.18.1 and below. Enjoy!**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Click here to go to config datapack download page**

&nbsp;

*Note: Be sure to read the instructions in the above link's page to make it easier to know what to edit*

By default, RS will do its best to import modded loot into its structures's loot. If this is not desired behavior, you can disable this in the normal RS config file in config folder above mods folder.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, you can make datapacks to modify or change how RS structures look! Here's a flat world of all the pieces of my structures. Use this to make editing and overriding structure pieces easier with datapacks: Repurposed Structures - pieces world (click here)**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the expert datapackers, there's actually a hidden neat way to add new pieces to any Jigsaw Structure without overriding their pool file! (Villages, outposts, all of RS's structures minus mansions, etc) For example, instead of overriding `data\repurposed_structures\worldgen\template_pool\village\birch\houses.json` to add new houses to my Birch Village, replace `worldgen\template` in the datapack with `pool_additions` and have the template pool file only have the entries you want merged into the main pool file. Repurposed Structures will detect these files from ALL datapacks and merge the pool_additions pool entries into the actual template pool file that the path points to. Yes, Repurposed Structures will read all pool_additions files from all datapacks that even have the same path so that the datapacks do not override each other's pool_additions! Neat stuff! And it works with other pools too! Just make sure the piece you are adding has a Jigsaw Block with the right name so the actual structure can connect and spawn the piece.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help you with this cool pool_additions feature, this 18 minute tutorial should help walk you through creating a building, saving it, and adding it to RS's structures with a datapack! **https://youtu.be/kzRQrQqlYjw**



1.18.1 and older info:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**To reach this mod's config file, go into the config folder that is above the mods folder and go into the repurposed_structures-forge folder to change the configs. The config is split up into many files for better organization and ease of editing. Then exit/restart Minecraft for all changes to take effect. Do note that the config will affect all worlds so keep that in mind**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now, there are lots of config options. The big one that you may be interested in is the spawnrate config for every structure and yes, you can even fully turn off the structures too. The config comments will help walk you through on how to adjust the rates. Furthermore, you can even blacklist dimensions or biomes as well! For some structures, you can change the maximum and minimum y value that they can start their generation at and far more! Check out the config for everything you can do!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, you can make datapacks to modify or change a huge amount of stuff in my mod including modifying how structures look! Here's a flat world of all the pieces of my nbt-based structures. Use this to make editing and overriding structure pieces easier with datapacks: **Repurposed Structures - pieces world (click here)**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to change the loot tables that the structures in this mod uses, you can override my loot tables with a data pack! Here's a datapack with the default loot tables: **Repurposed_Structures-Loottables (click here) **

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mob spawner for all none-nbt based structures can be changed with datapacks as well! You can download the spawner datapack here and change the entries inside the json files to add, remove, or change mob chances in spawners!: **Repurposed_Structures-Mob_Spawners (click here)**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all structure pieces such as Wells, Villages, Outposts, Shipwrecks, Pyramids, and Igloos can also be overridden with datapacks. Furthermore, the template pools that holds structure pieces for Villages and other structures can also be overridden with datapacks to add your own pieces to the villages or other structures! You can find what pieces or pools can be replaced and their filenames here but be sure to switch the branch to the MC version you are on: Overridable structure nbt files (click here)Overridable structure pool files (click here)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the expert datapackers, there's actually a hidden neat way to add new pieces to any Jigsaw Structure without overriding their pool file! (Villages, outposts, all of RS's structures minus mansions, etc) For example, instead of overriding `data\repurposed_structures\worldgen\template_pool\village\birch\houses.json` to add new houses to my Birch Village, replace `worldgen\template` in the datapack with `pool_additions` and have the template pool file only have the entries you want merged into the main pool file.

**If you get stuck or confused on how to configure something, just ask and I'll try and help out!**



***

### **🏠 PRE-MADE DATAPACKS 🏠**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the overwhelming majority of my structures uses nbt files, template pools, and/or processors, you can override all of this with datapacks! That means you can customize the blocks in those structures with other mod's blocks or add pieces of other mod's villages into RS's villages! If you decide to use the datapacks below, download it, go into your world's save folder, and put the zipped folder into the datapack folder. Now when you load the game, the datapack should take effect! (Also, you can share mod-compat datapacks you made to me and I'll add it below after I check it out and like it!)

Check out the wiki below for some links to premade datapacks!

## Roughly Enough Trades

REI category showing villager trades

Video demo: https://youtu.be/Ah-Pya-_ir8


##### General info
This mod for both Fabric and Forge is an add-on to Roughly Enough Items, providing a new category - villager trades. Every vanilla trade is guaranteed to be listed.

RET is fully client-side, installing it on a server is useless (might just crash it).

Some trades change item nbt (enchanting, dying, map filling). In such cases RET surrounds the resulting item's name with * signs, like \*Diamond Boots\*.

Pigling bartering is not supported because it relies on server-side data.


##### Mod compability
The problem with villager trades is that modders can easily define their own types, making it impossible for RET to fetch the data. In such cases, it rolls a few random "offers" (basically simulates what happens when you click on a villager). The resulting data is not accurate and not fullfilling, but it is still better than nothing. You can understand that RNG happened by finding and entry like this:

## Simple Copper Pipes

Adds vanilla-friendly copper pipes to Minecraft!

REQUIRES FABRIC API

Copper pipes can quickly and easily transport items from one place to another! Simply build a pipeline and you're good to go.

The part of the pipe with the protruding opening is the direction items will flow in. If there is no block in front of the pipe the items will shoot out, so be careful!

Pipes can also insert items into any block with an inventory like chests, hoppers, and barrels, and themselves.
Copper Pipes are crafted just how you think they'd be- three copper in a row, an empty row, and three more copper.
 

CREDITS:
lunadedogs/Lunade - Programming
I_am_Merp - Models, Textures, and Sounds

Moving And Dispensing Items:

If a Copper Pipe is pointing into air or water, it will automatically shoot out its items. To prevent this, placing something as simple as a Torch in front of it will suffice.

Copper Pipes will deposit their items into inventories like Chests, Barrels, and the Copper Fitting. They can also take out these items from those blocks, making them easy to use for intersections and storage.

Copper Pipes with Dispensers behind them will shoot items farther depending on their oxidization state and color, and Copper Pipes with Droppers behind them will shoot items out at a medium range, regardless of oxidization and color.

Copper Pipes that are being powered by Redstone will "shoot" specific items like Arrows, Splash Potions, and Snowballs, making them more versatile.

Different pipes have different cooldowns. Waxed pipes are the fastest, while normal pipes are slightly slower. Corroded Pipes are the slowest, and Colored Pipes have a medium speed.

If a Copper Fitting is placed behind a Copper Pipe, the pipe's transferring cooldown will be based on the fitting's cooldown instead, and no noise will be created when Dispensing/Shooting out items. Certain items like Ink Sacs, Glow Ink Sacs, and Sculk Sensors will emit particles and not be shot out of pipes if a Copper Fitting is placed behind them. This is useful for decoration, but keep it in mind in case this may hinder your pipelines.

Copper Fittings will prevent the flow of items whilst being powered.

Smoke And Water Leaking:

Copper Pipes are able to leak water and smoke under specific circumstances.

If a Pipe is Waterlogged or Water is placed directly behind the Pipe, the water will move along the Pipeline. This is visualized with drops of water falling from pipes.

Water will flow through up to 12 pipes, where it will then stop. By placing Copper Fittings in the Pipeline, you can renew the flow of water as much as you'd like.

Farmland can stay damp if under a leaking pipe that's up to 12 blocks above it and Sugar Cane are able to 
grow under these same circumstances, removing the need for you to place them next to water sources.

All mobs will be considered to be in water if under a pipe that's up to 12 blocks above them, meaning that all mobs will be extinguished if under a pipe, and Endermen will be damaged by walking under a Leaking Pipe.

Smoke follows these same rules, needing a Lit Campfire to be placed behind the entry pipe. Copper Fittings will renew the flow of smoke.

Bee Hives and Bee Nests will count Smoking Pipes as Campfires, allowing Copper Pipes to be used in honey farming.

Oxidization, Waxing, Lightning, Corrosion, And Coloring:

All Copper Pipes and Copper Fittings will oxidize over time. To prevent this, you can alt-click on one with a Honeycomb, or combine and Honeycomb and a Pipe/Fitting in a Crafting Table. Waxed Pipes will transport items faster, making them a more preferable choice.

Alt-clicking on a Pipe or Fitting will remove its wax, and if it's unwaxed, will revert its oxidization stage by one.

Copper Pipes and Copper Fittings can de-oxidize from lightning, but you'll have to set them up properly for it to work.

When a Lightning Rod is triggered on top of (or directly next to) a pipe or fitting, electricity will surge through the entire pipeline.

Each time a pipe or fitting receives electricity they'll de-oxidize by one stage, and glowing pipes/fittings will glow. You can even take the normally permanent corrosion off of corroded pipes and fittings this way!
If a Pipe or Fitting is completely oxidized, you can put it in a furnace to Corrode it.

Corroded Pipes and Fittings can be dyed, and said Dyed Pipes/Fittings can be combined with Glow Ink Sacs to make them Glow when an item is inside of them.

These are useful for decoration and light displays, or for keeping track of which pipes your items are in.

Colored Pipes will shoot ink of its color when a Fitting is placed behind it and it has an Ink Sac in its inventory.

Colored Pipes are also silent.

Vibrations:

When a Copper Pipe's opening is exposed to air, it will pick up Vibrations and send them through the pipeline, which can be used to distract Wardens or work with Sculk's mechanics easier.

All Copper Pipes with an exposed opening will pick up Vibrations, though the Vibration particle will only appear if a Block or Entity that can listen to it is around; this can be controlled via tags, but keep in mind that this is purely visual- the Vibrations will still be emitted.

Note Blocks will also be picked up by pipes, which will also be sent through pipelines like vibrations.

Copper Fittings are not required to renew Vibrations as they can travel through entire pipelines on their own as of 1.10.

Other:

Alternate-Clicking on a pipe with a hoe will rotate it.
Pipes will bubble underwater.

## Smooth Swapping

Moves items smoothly in inventories

This mod moves items in inventories smoothly instead of letting them appear instantly.&nbsp;
When shift-clicking or using the hotbar key-binds to move items in an inventory they will travel from their old inventory slot to the new one.
&nbsp;

Be aware that this mod is really choppy when you have less than 30 FPS.&nbsp;

Sodium is a **free and open-source** rendering optimization mod for Minecraft 1.16+ which greatly improves frame rates and stuttering while fixing many graphical issues. It boasts wide compatibility with the Fabric mod ecosystem when compared to other rendering-focused mods, and it does so without compromising on how the game looks, giving you that authentic block game feel.

### 📥 Installation guide

Make sure you have the latest version of [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use/) installed. Afterwards, all you need to do is simply drop the mod into your mods folder. No other mods or downloads are required in order to use Sodium. You do not need to create new worlds in order to take advantage of the mod.

Not sure if you installed the mod correctly? Try checking your _Video Settings_ screen in Minecraft, which should show our new and improved user interface for changing settings.

Out of the box, Sodium will enable all optimizations which are supported on your system, meaning no additional configuration is needed. You should generally only change video settings related to performance and other advanced features if you are experiencing issues.

➡️ **Note:** By design, Sodium only optimizes the client rendering code. You should also install our other mods, such as [Lithium](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium) and [Phosphor](https://modrinth.com/mod/phosphor), to optimize the other parts of your game. This is done so that players can pick and choose which mods they want to use, but we generally recommend using [our entire collection](https://modrinth.com/user/jellysquid3).

### 🔥 Performance

The following performance comparisons have been contributed by our community, and show how Sodium can improve frame rates for a wide range of computers, whether fast or slow. Many of our players report a **250% to 500% increase** in average frame rates.

### ✅ Compatibility

Sodium is mostly stable at this point, but it does not yet contain support for the Fabric Rendering API, which a small number of mods currently use. If you try to use these mods with Sodium, your game may crash or behave unexpectedly.

We try to ensure compatibility with most graphics cards that have up-to-date drivers for OpenGL 4.6 Core, which covers most graphics cards released after mid-2010.

- INTEL HD Graphics 500 Series (Skylake) or newer
- NVIDIA GeForce 400 Series (Fermi) or newer
- AMD Radeon HD 7000 Series (GCN 1) or newer
 
Older graphics cards may also work (so long as they have up-to-date drivers for at least OpenGL 3.3 Core), but hardware requirements are subject to change in future releases.

If you encounter issues with Sodium, you should [make sure that your graphics drivers are up-to-date](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/4409137348877-Minecraft-Java-Edition-Game-Crashes-and-Performance-Issues-FAQ#h_01FFNR5S1APTFHGR9K2W3JANZ4), as this is the most often the culprit of poor performance, crashes, and rendering bugs.

### ⚙️ Technical details

Of course, we can't just say that the game is magically faster without providing some kind of explanation. This list tries to cover some of the most significant changes which are responsible for performance improvements, but it's not complete or exhaustive of everything Sodium does.

- A modern OpenGL rendering pipeline for chunk rendering that takes advantage of multi-draw techniques, allowing for a significant reduction in CPU overhead (~90%) when rendering the world. This can make a huge difference to frame rates for most computers that are not bottle-necked by the GPU or other components. Even if your GPU can't keep up, you'll experience much more stable frame times thanks to the CPU being able to work on other rendering tasks while it waits.

- Vertex data for rendered chunks is made much more compact, allowing for video memory and bandwidth requirements to be cut by almost 40%.

- Nearby block updates now take advantage of multi-threading, greatly reducing lag spikes caused by chunks needing to be updated. ([before](https://streamable.com/lm5sp5), [after](https://streamable.com/nsdl0r))

- Chunk faces which are not visible (or facing away from the camera) are culled very early in the rendering process, eliminating a ton of geometry that would have to be processed on the GPU only to be immediately discarded. For integrated GPUs, this can greatly reduce memory bandwidth requirements and provide a modest speedup even when GPU-bound.

- Plentiful optimizations for chunk loading and block rendering, making chunk loading significantly faster and less damaging to frame rates. ([before](https://streamable.com/3taw22), [after](https://streamable.com/4pesh2))

- Many optimizations for vertex building and matrix transformations, speeding up block entity, mob, and item rendering significantly for when you get carried away placing too many chests in one room.

- Many improvements to how the game manages memory and allocates objects, which in turn reduces memory consumption and lag spikes caused by garbage collector activity.

- Many graphical fixes for smooth lighting effects, making the game run better while still applying a healthy amount of optimization. For example, take this [before and after](https://i.imgur.com/lYmlmgq.png) of a white concrete room in vanilla, or this [comparison while underwater](https://i.imgur.com/QQMuOTy.png).

- Smooth lighting for fluids and other special blocks. ([comparison](https://i.imgur.com/z9HBcvq.png))

- Smooth biome blending for blocks and fluids, providing greatly improved graphical quality that is significantly less computationally intensive.  ([comparison](https://i.imgur.com/Fud5oyF.png))

- Animated textures which are not visible in the world are not updated, speeding up texture updating on most hardware (especially AMD cards.)

... and much more, this list is still being written after the initial release.

## Starlight (Fabric)

Rewrites the light engine to fix lighting performance and lighting errors

Starlight
==================
Fabric mod for rewriting the light engine to fix lighting performance and lighting errors.

Compatibility
------------------
Starlight can be installed either on the dedicated server or client. It is _not_ required to be installed on both sides.
If you have Starlight on the server, clients can use Vanilla/Phosphor/Starlight to connect. Likewise, if you have Starlight on 
the client, you can connect to Vanilla/Phosphor/Starlight servers.

Starlight cannot be installed _with_ Phosphor, they are completely incompatible. 
Browsing through [Starlight's Issue Tracker](https://github.com/PaperMC/Starlight/issues "Starlight's Issue Tracker") will show
further mod incompatibilities. Starlight is a rather destructive light engine rewrite, so it should be 
expected to break mods more often.

Purpose
------------------
Starlight was developed for higher scale dedicated servers, as they suffered performance problems due to how ungodly slow the
light engine was. The only solution was to create an extremely invasive mod which rewrote the entire light engine.
I ported the mod to fabric so that I can update it during snapshots, and decided that publishing it for 
all users, especially client users, would be beneficial. However, it does have the downside of being an invasive mod:
Being invasive didn't affect higher scale servers because they run on Bukkit.

Further reading on the technical details of how Starlight achieves its performance 
can be read here: [TECHNICAL_DETAILS.md](https://github.com/PaperMC/Starlight/blob/fabric/TECHNICAL_DETAILS.md "TECHNICAL_DETAILS.md")

Performance
------------------
Here are a few graphs showing performance in 3 critical areas: Chunk generation, Block editing at high y-levels, and normal block light updates:

![Light engine time chunk generation Graph](https://i.imgur.com/5aI8Eaf.png "Light engine time chunk generation Graph")

## Tax Free Levels

Flattens the ever-increasing anvil and enchantment costs and makes renaming items always cost 1 level

Reaching high levels in Minecraft is hard, because each level requires more XP than the last.  

Since Anvils and Enchantment Tables work off of levels, not off of collected XP, that means the higher your level, the higher the actual cost in terms of XP.  

Tax Free Levels "flattens the curve" of the ever-increasing anvil and enchantment costs above level 30, meaning you'll always pay the same amount of XP, regardless of how high your level is.   
It also makes it so that renaming an item always only costs 1 level.  

More precisely:  
If you are above level 30, instead of e.g. paying 3 levels, you pay the amount of XP needed to get from level 27 to 30.  
If the level cost is above 30, you pay the amount of XP needed to get from 0 to that level.

* for Fabric Minecraft 1.16-1.19
* required on the server and client
* (it *does* work server-only, but the level cost won't show up correctly when renaming items)
* compatible with Draylar1's [Reroll](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/reroll)
* compatible with [Enchanting Overhauled](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/enchanting-overhauled)

#### Comparison

Say you've just slain the Ender Dragon for the first time and reached level 68.  
In Vanilla, you can level 3 enchant a total of 13 items.  
With Tax Free Levels, this changes to 35 items, your Ender Dragon kill actually counts for something!  

Say again, you reached level 68 and want to apply another enchantment on your pick which has a very high repair cost and it'd cost 35 levels.  
In Vanilla, you pay 10220 XP (the XP needed to get from level 33 to 68).  
With Tax Free Levels, you pay 2045 XP (the XP needed to get from level 0 to 35).  

You'd normally lose 8000 of your 12000 XP dragon reward here and there!

#### No Small Tax

One small tidbit about vanilla Minecraft is that paying levels doesn't actually touch the percental experience progress.  
Since higher levels are worth more XP, this means you actually not only pay levels but also a small amount of XP.  
Tax Free Levels gets rid of this tax as well, even at lower player levels.

## Terrestria

Terrestria is a detailed and vibrant biomes mod for Minecraft running on the Fabric mod loader.


Terrestria is a detailed and vibrant biomes mod for Minecraft running on the Fabric mod loader. Terrestria enhances gameplay through the addition of 17 major biomes supported by 24 component biomes, 9 new wood types, as well as a healthy selection of foliage - providing a refreshing new selection of terrain.

Terrestria requires Fabric Loader and Fabric API&nbsp;
Check out the Terraformers Discord Server to chat about Terrestria and other Fabric mods!
Visit the Terrestria Wiki to learn more about each biome
The goal of Terrestria is to be the most polished and visually appealing biomes mod available for Minecraft, and to this end there has been intense focus on selecting, detailing, and refining the biomes until they look absolutely amazing. Rather than add tons of different biomes, focus has been put into adding a rather small amount of biomes and then populating them with large amounts of detail and component biomes. This overall results in a more cohesive experience compared to existing biome mods.
Biomes:
v1.0.0 - Initial Release

Caldera
Cypress Forest
Cypress Swamp
Dense Woodlands
Hemlock Rainforest
Japanese Maple Forest
Lush Redwood Forest
Rainbow Rainforest
Redwood Forest
Sakura Forest
Snowy Hemlock Forest
Volcanic Island

v2.0.0 - The Dry Update

Canyon
Dunes
Lush Desert
Oasis
Outback

Some biomes contain variants to increase variety
Images of the biomes can be found on the Images page.
&nbsp;
Other Mods by Terraformers:
Check out Terrestria's sister mod, Traverse:

Traverse works well alongside Terrestria if you are looking for a set of biomes that are closer to the Vanilla+ ideal. Traverse has a lot of unique, colorful biomes that embrace the simple vanilla aesthetic instead of trying to overshadow it.
Check out the Terraformers Nether biome expansion, Cinderscapes:

Cinderscapes complements Terrestria by providing an expansion to the nether, much like Terrestria does to the overworld. Cinderscapes brings more life and beauty to the nether, while also keeping it frightening.&nbsp;
Campanion, your camping companion:

Campanion adds various tools and utilities to help improve your adventures away from your home. Campanion also works well alongside Terrestria in order to make the exploration of the biomes even more fun.
&nbsp;
Terrestria is a mod for Fabric, and there are no plans to port this mod to Forge.

## Things

Trinkets and Utilities to enhance casual play

### Overview


Things is a collection of many small and a few bigger items and features that I feel enhance the vanilla experience in a mostly non-intrusive way

⠀

**Curios API** is required for versions *before 1.17*

**Trinkets API** is required for versions *1.17 and onwards*

⠀

Most items have minimalistic documentation in their tooltip, **Patchouli** is highly recommended however as there is a very fleshed out book. You get this when first loading into a world, and can also make a new one by Right-Clicking Gleaming Ore with a book.

⠀


### Quick Walkthrough of some of the more notable items:

![Displacement Tome](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/347/390/displacement_tome.png)

The Displacement Tome is an item inspired by Warp Book and it's many clones that allows you to teleport to up to 8 locations and uses Ender Pearls as fuel.
It is very expensive in a semi-vanilla context, in bigger modpacks it would need to be balanced though

⠀

![Bater Wucket](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/347/392/bater_wucket.png)

The Bater Wucket is an infinite water bucket. That's it

⠀

![Ender Pouch](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/347/391/ender_pouch.png)

The Ender Pouch is a portable Ender Chest accessed through a Keybind

⠀

![Enchanted Wax Gland](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/347/393/wax_gland.png)

The Enchanted Wax Gland is inspired by Trinkets and Bauble's Stone of the Sea. It makes you float in water and also gives a great speed boost.
You can also combine with another item to even make it work in Lava!

## Traverse

A biome expansion mod that embraces the simplistic nature of Minecraft biomes


Traverse aims to expand upon, but not replace or overshadow, Minecraft biomes. Traverse embraces the simplistic nature of many vanilla biomes and the goal is to have the biomes fit in just right so that Mojang could add them into the base game and nobody would complain that they felt out of place.

Traverse requires Fabric Loader and Fabric API&nbsp;
Check out the Terraformers Discord Server to chat about Traverse and other Fabric mods!
Visit the Traverse Wiki to learn more about each biome
Biomes:

Autumnal Woods
Coniferous Forest
Desert Shrubland
Flatlands
Lush Swamp
Snowy Coniferous Forest
Woodlands

Images of the biomes can be found on the Images page.
&nbsp;
Other Mods by Terraformers:
Check out Traverse's sister mod, Terrestria:

Terrestria works well alongside Traverse if you are looking for a more extensive biome enhancement experience. Terrestria has a lot of highly unique and detailed biomes that may exceed the "Vanilla+" category that Traverse fits into.
Check out the Terraformers Nether biome expansion, Cinderscapes:

Cinderscapes complements Traverse by providing an expansion to the nether, much like Traverse does to the overworld. Cinderscapes brings more life and beauty to the nether, while also keeping it frightening.&nbsp;
Campanion, your camping companion:

Campanion adds various tools and utilities to help improve your adventures away from your home. Campanion also works well alongside Traverse in order to make the exploration of Traverse biomes even more fun.
&nbsp;
Traverse is a mod for Fabric, and there are no plans to port this mod to Forge.
However, another team is maintaining a Forge fork of this mod at Traverse: Legacy Continued.
Traverse: Legacy Continued is unaffiliated with Terraformers, so please do not ask us for support regarding their mod.

## Trinkets

A data-driven accessory mod

## Trinkets
A data-driven accessory mod for Minecraft using Fabric.

![Image of the Trinkets UI](https://i.imgur.com/CgWhc5a.png)

### About
Trinkets adds a slot group and slot system to Minecraft. Slot groups are collections of slots for a certain body part or more vague area. By default there are 6 slot groups (head, chest, legs, feet, offhand, hand) that can have slots added to them, but more groups can be added if desired. Trinkets' UI is intuitive to use, accessible, and attempts to do away with clutter. Its system means that you'll never have a slot that's not used for anything, as mods request the slots they want.

- Elytra Trinket (Fabric)
- MinecraftCapes (not on all Minecraft/mod-loader versions!)

### Update 1.3.0

- Added a new "Simulation V2" mode (new default setting), which allows the cape to move left and right slightly, prevents too-hard bends/cape clipping into itself, and entirely new underwater physics and behavior.
- Fixed a lot of edge cases, where the cape would become oddly thin, tilted, or inverted.
- Using the Wind Mode "Waves" will now slow down while underwater.

### FAQ

- Q: How do I access the config screen?
  A: The config screen is accessible via the mod-list (requires Mod Menu on fabric).
- Q: Does this mod work on servers?
  A: No, this mod is purely visual and fully clientside, so it doesn't have to be installed on servers.
- Q: Does this mod work with Optifine?
  A: Optifine does not support the new cape rendering, it will use the old style.
- Q: How do I get the cape to look like the older versions of the mod?
  A: You can change between rendering styles, cape behavior, and wind effects in the config screen.

Yet Another Config Lib, like, what were you expecting?
  
[![](https://www.bisecthosting.com/partners/custom-banners/08bbd3ff-5c0d-4480-8738-de0f070a04dd.png)](https://bisecthosting.com/xander)



### Why does this mod even exist?

This mod was made to fill a hole in this area of Fabric modding. The existing main config libraries don't achieve what I want from them:

- **[Cloth Config API](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config)**:**It's stale.** The developer of cloth has clarified that they are likely not going to add any more features. They don't want to touch it. ([citation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43245524/206530322-3ae46008-5356-468e-9a73-63b859364d4e.png))
- **[SpruceUI](https://github.com/LambdAurora/SpruceUI)**:**It isn't designed for configuration.** In this essence the design feels cluttered. Further details available in [this issue](https://github.com/isXander/Zoomify/issues/85).
- **[MidnightLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/midnightlib)**:**It has cosmetics among other utilities.** It may not be large but some players (including me) wouldn't want cosmetics out of nowhere.
- **[OwoLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/owo-lib)**:**It's content focused.** It does a lot of other things as well as config, adding to the size.

As you can see, there's sadly a drawback with all of them and this is where YetAnotherConfigLib comes in.

### How is YACL better?

YACL has the favour of hindsight. Whilst developing this fresh library, I can make sure that it does everything right:

- **Client sided library.** YACL is built for client mods only, making it a smaller size.
- **Easy API.** YACL takes inspiration from [Sodium's](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) internal configuration library.
- **It's styled to fit in Minecraft.** YACL's GUI is designed to fit right in.

### Usage

[The wiki](https://github.com/isXander/YetAnotherConfigLib/wiki/Usage) contains a full documentation on how to use YACL.

## You're in Grave Danger

A mod focused around death. Will add graves to minecraft

## You're in Grave Danger

Get it?






### About

You're in Grave Danger is a highly configurable grave mod.
This mod will add graves to your game, which will spawn at your death location with all your items. You can then go back and retrieve your lost items. The mod will remember your inventory layout and put everything back to where it was before you died. The mod is highly configurable. In fact, if you think a config is missing that has anything to do with what happens when you die, it's not refered to as a missing feature, but a bug. (Not really but that's how serious I am about everything being configurable). 

 

If you play multiplayer you'll have no trouble finding which grave is yours, as both your face and player name will render on it (if you've enabled it in the config of course)

 

### Features

The mod is available for 1.16.5, 1.17.1, and 1.18!

As 1.18 is the newest version of minecraft, 1.18 will be the version most updates are pushed to. This is why you will often find more features in this version than the other versions. However once in a while the 1.16.5 and 1.17.1 will be backported from the newest version. Any issues found with earlier versions will also be handled.

The mod aims to be compatible with most, if not all inventory mods. Currently You're in Grave Danger provides compat for: inventorio [all versions], trinkets [all versions], curios [1.16], travelers backpack [1.16, 1.17]

Other inventory mods are also compatible with this mod, including backslot, extra inventory and BigInv. The mod will also work with infinitory, however that compatibility is not well tested. If any of the listed mods would not be compatible, or you know another mod affecting the inventory, please open an issue in the mod github repository, or report it in the discord server.

The mod is technically compatible with every soulbound enchantment, since you can configure which enchantments should not be dropped on death in your grave, and which you should as well keep in your inventory when you respawn. 

Graves can be waterlogged, and renders can be adapted to the block the grave is standing on.

Graves can be completely customized with resource packs in all versions. They will affect block hitbox, render parts, the grave skull and grave text. 

More features are also provided, however some of these are disabled by default as most people probably don't want these issues as a part of the mod. 

### Misc info

If you find any bug/missing config, or have a cool idea that would fit in the theme of the mod, please open an issue on the [github issue tracker](https://github.com/B1n-ry/Youre-in-grave-danger/issues)

The mod is under MIT license, so feel free to use this in your modpack!

This mod is required both on client and server, as it will add custom blocks and renderers.

*A zoom mod with infinite customizability.*
  
Zoomify aims to provide the easiest, most configurable and most sexy looking zoom mod you will ever find.

![Zoom Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/zoom-example.gif)
  
[![](https://www.bisecthosting.com/partners/custom-banners/08bbd3ff-5c0d-4480-8738-de0f070a04dd.png)](https://bisecthosting.com/xander)
  


### How to use
#### Keybind
Initially, Minecraft has a keybind that overrides Zoomify by default.
Go to the controls menu and make sure the Zoomify keybind (default `C`)
isn't conflicting (goes red).

#### Open settings menu
You can access the settings menu with two ways.

- The client command `/zoomify`
- [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) settings button

### Features
#### Scroll Zoom
You can zoom in further using your scroll wheel.

![Scroll Zoom Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/scroll-zoom-example.gif)

#### Spyglass Integration
You can configure Zoomify to only be able to zoom in when you are holding or carrying a spyglass.
Or even just override the spyglass zoom with Zoomify!

Show the spyglass overlay and play spyglass sound effects when using Zoomify.

![Spyglass Integration Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/spyglass-integration-example.gif)

#### Transitions
**14 different** transitions to choose from!

- Instant
- Linear
- [Ease in Sine](https://easings.net/#easeInSine)
- [Ease out Sine](https://easings.net/#easeOutSine)
- [Ease in/out Sine](https://easings.net/#easeInOutSine)
- [Ease in Quad](https://easings.net/#easeInQuad)
- [Ease out Quad](https://easings.net/#easeOutQuad)
- [Ease in/out Quad](https://easings.net/#easeInOutQuad)
- [Ease in Cubic](https://easings.net/#easeInCubic)
- [Ease out Cubic](https://easings.net/#easeOutCubic)
- [Ease in/out Cubic](https://easings.net/#easeInOutCubic)
- [Ease in Exponential](https://easings.net/#easeInExp)
- [Ease out Exponential](https://easings.net/#easeOutExp)
- [Ease in/out Exponential](https://easings.net/#easeInOutExp)

You can even pick what transition you would like for zooming in and out individually!

![Individual Transition Config](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/individual-transition.png)

#### Relative Sensitivity
Reduce your mouse sensitivity based on the amount of zoom,
so you have fine control over your player.

![Relative Sensitivity Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/relative-sensitivity-example.gif)

#### Relative View Bobbing
Reduce the view bobbing effect based on the amount of zoom,
so you can walk and zoom at the same time!

![Relative View Bobbing Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/relative-view-bobbing-example.gif)

#### Cinematic Camera
Make the mouse/camera smooth, like the zoom in [OptiFine](https://www.optifine.net).

![Cinematic Cam Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/cinematic-cam-example.gif)

#### Affect Hand FOV
Turn off this setting to prevent your hand from also being zoomed in!

![Affect Hand FOV Turned Off Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/affect-hand-fov-disabled-example.gif)

#### Secondary Zoom

Completely separate zoom from normal Zoomify.
Aimed for content creators, features `Hide HUD While Zooming` option and longer zoom in times.

![Secondary Zoom Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/secondary-zoom.gif)

#### Presets

You can reset to default, make Zoomify behave like OptiFine and others!

#### Smart Keybinding Detection

On first launch, if a keybinding is conflicting with Zoomify's zoom, a notification will appear notifying them of this.

![Keybinding Conflict Detection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/keybind-conflict-detection.png)

#### Highly configurable
Absolutely **NO** hard-coded values. Everything about your zoom is configurable!

#### Control the zoom speed with seconds
Instead of some stupid arbitrary value such as zoom speed, you can pick
the exact amount of seconds it will take to zoom in, with a separate setting for zooming out.
